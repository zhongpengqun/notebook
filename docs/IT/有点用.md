sqlalchemy create_engine sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (2006, "MySQL server has gone away

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16341911/sqlalchemy-error-mysql-server-has-gone-away
    - db_engine = create_engine(f'mysql+mysqldb://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DBNAME}?charset=utf8', pool_pre_ping=True)
    ```
    Pessimistic testing of connections upon checkout is achievable by using the Pool.pre_ping argument, available from create_engine() via the create_engine.pool_pre_ping argument:

    The “pre ping” feature will normally emit SQL equivalent to “SELECT 1” each time a connection is checked out from the pool; if an error is raised that is detected as a “disconnect” situation, the connection will be immediately recycled, and all other pooled connections older than the current time are invalidated, so that the next time they are checked out, they will also be recycled before use.
    ```
    - create_engine(url, pool_recycle=3600)
    ```
    this setting causes the pool to recycle connections after the given number of seconds has passed. It defaults to -1, or no timeout. For example, setting to 3600 means connections will be recycled after one hour. Note that MySQL in particular will disconnect automatically if no activity is detected on a connection for eight hours
    ```
```
