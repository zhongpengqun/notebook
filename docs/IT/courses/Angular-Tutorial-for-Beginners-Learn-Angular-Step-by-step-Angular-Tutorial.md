Greetings!

Today we are going to learn `Angular fundamentals`, angular basics in `flat 2 Hours`.

There are many youtubers there who 
will say make you an angular pro in  

some hours, some `claim` like 10 minutes.

I have been in Angular for past 
10 years I started from Angular 1  

and now I am doing the new version of Angular.

I have taught lots of corporates, have 
been a speaker in angular conferences  

and also handled big projects in angular.

One thing is you need to go 
slow, `steady` to become a pro.

1001% guarantee if you go through this 2 hours 
the basics of angular you should be able to do it,  

should be able to create an UI, do the 
binding, show the data in the grid and so on.

This is completely a beginners 
tutorial and will go `very step by step`.

On my screen you can see the `syllabus`. Have  

divided the syllabus into 10 Parts 
right from basics 

what is angular?

Started with the definition of Angular 
after that have gone to the installation,  

typescript, creating angular project, 
understanding the file structure  

and fundamentals like decorators, components, 
modules, whole flow of Angular - binding,  

expression, `interpolation` and 
different types of binding.

- interpolation 插值;插补文字;插入文字 

Go through this 2 Hours and I can 1001% 
guarantee that you are inside Angular.

Its a 2 hours of tutorial you 
will have lot of problems.

When you get any problem down below in youtube 
comments just put the timestamp saying this is  

where I am facing a problem and we will 
try to answer to all the youtube comments.

When you put a comment make it very detail 
saying I got this error here and so on.

To create such kind of contents 
it takes lot of efforts.

For this 2 hours we have to do so much video 
editing, have the right source code at place,  

the trainer has to make sure everything works 
right, have the notes `at place` and so on.

- at place 在现场;在某地

If you really think someone `should be benefited` out there learn angular  

please share this video on your 
linkedin, twitter, facebook.

If you share this video anywhere, will give you 
this Angular Interview Questions ebook for free  

and send email at questpond@questpond.com 
, this ebook covers more than 50+ questions  

with detail answers and so on.

One is you should be able to the practical  

and another one is you should 
be able to clear interviews.

You should learn step by step at the 
same time and be ready for interviews.

Down below in the youtube comments have 
`pinned` a youtube comment where we have one  

hour of angular interview questions video , it 
will help you to prepare for interview as well.

Go in a balanced way.

`Let us get started with the definition of angular`, 
what is angular? who made angular and so on.

We are here on the official website angular.io

To know anything about angular which is 
officially out there then this is the website.

Angular is created, maintained 
and `funded` by google.

On this website there is a `small note out here` what is Angular?

- out here 在这里

Lets try to read and understand 
what exactly is Angular.

Angular is a development 
platform to build applications  

and specifically the UI part of the application.

Its a platform means it will provide a 
very well structured framework, libraries,  

tool sets and so on and that's exactly 
this development platform has - a very  

well structured component based framework by 
which we can create wonderful UI applications.

It has lots of ready made libraries - if you want 
to move from one UI to another UI it has routing,  

to create UI part it has forms, to make 
HTTP call it has HTTP client and so on.

Lot of libraries by which we can 
`expedite` the development and the last one  

- expedite 加快

it has developer tools to build, 
test and lot of other things.

Angular is a development platform 
and it is build on TypeScript.

Angular main focus is to create the UI part of the 
application and it has three things - a very nice  

well structured framework which is called 
as component based framework, it has  

lot of reusable libraries by which we can 
make HTTP calls, do validations, do routing.

The last one is awesome developer 
tools to build, test and so on.

Incase you have not understood the 
definition or `understood it partially`.

Later on we are going re-visit this 
definition by looking at the code.

At that time that would be more clear visibly.

Before we start the installation 
of angular, want to make a very  

important statement specially for 
people who are new to angular.

They have to get this statement because I've 
been teaching angular for past 10 years.

2010 Angular 1 was launched and some years 
Angular 2 the new family was launched.

One of the things which I've learnt about angular  

is that it is very easy to learn 
and understand but thought to start.

The pre-requisite of Angular.

Pre-requisite of Angular sometimes makes a 
developer very tired and they `loose stamina`.
- 体力松弛

The first thing in the 
pre-requisite is the Installation.

The installation is not that complex. We 
need node, vs code, angular CLI, typescript  

but you can get some of those exception and 
some of those exceptions are so weird and bad  

if some of the versions do not match 
it can really lead to a problem.

The first part is installation.

The second is we have to understand Node and 
we should be able to use NPM very effectively.

We have to just understand what is Node but NPM 
package.json part we have to understand `in detail`.

After this we have to understand 
TypeScript because the complete  

Angular is based on TypeScript.

At least the basic of typescript,  

how to compile typescript, what exactly 
is typescript and then the Angular CLI.

How to use Angular CLI, how 
to install it and so on.

After that we can start learning.

Angular is easy to learn but there 
is a long way to start learning.

These are the pre-requisites.

In the first one hour we 
will do the pre-requisite.

We will understand all these things and 
next 1 hour we will do the learning.

`Coming 2 hours` is `divided into two parts` - first 
one is the pre-requisite and Start learning.

Here is the syllabus for the coming 2 hours.

We are already done with what is Angular, 
we have looked into pre-requisite.

The first 25 minutes we 
will spend on installation.

After that we will try to understand 
node and NPM that will take 15 Minutes.

Then we will look into TypeScript 
that will take more 15 mins.

Then we will install Angular CLI, how to 
create project which will take 15 mins.

After that we will start 
understanding the project of Angular.

Will get into important basic concepts like 
decorator, components, modules and directives.

Then we will look into angular bootstrapping 
flow, bindings, different types of binding.

Will create simple project where we 
will do table binding logic and so on.

We `assure you 1001% if you do this 2 hours 
`religiously` you should be inside Angular.
- religiously 虔诚地

To complete the first two 
hours you can go really slow.

Today just do the installation.

Then after 2 or 3 days come back and say  

lets do the next 15 mins and 
then lets do the next 15 mins.

Lets get started with the next 
part, the installation of Angular.

The first step to install VS code 
is google VS code and you will get  


download for windows stable build 
and it will start downloading.

There is something called 
as VS Code & Visual Studio.

We should not be installing visual 
studio, visual studio is very good for  

C#, MVC and it can do angular as 
well but for now install VS Code.

They all belong to the same family, they come from 
MicroSoft but this is what our choice should be.

`Make a note of that` Visual Code 
and Visual Studio are different.

After downloading VS Code we 
will get such kind of setup.

If your machine is not 64 bit then the 
appropriate download should be made.

If there is any problem in the installation 
send us email at questpond@questpond.com,  

we are more than happy to help you.

Run this, accept the agreement.

VS Code installation is damn simple we 
have to do just Next Next and Install.

Once the installation finishes there 
is a small check box saying Launch  

Visual Studio Code, will 
uncheck it and click finish.

You can search here VS Code has been installed.

Whenever you are opening visual studio for  

coding either Angular or React( for 
anything) always open in admin mode.

Run as an administrator. This is very 
important step specifically for angular  

lot of times we do installation and for 
those installation we need admin rights.

First you will see something called 
as get started and just close it.

Create a folder, Open folder.

In VS Code we do not open project,  

solution file we open folder, all 
your source code into a folder.

In D drive will create a 
folder saying Learn Angular.

Whatever code we will write 
will be in this folder.

Do "Select Folder" , there is a small box which  


`At the left hand side` there is 
a file explorer "Learn Angular"  

and we can create Files in this folder.

In case you are new in VS Code 
don't have to worry too much,  

whatever we are doing in this 
demo just try to follow that.

`make fonts bigger` and write HTML code `out here`.

It has some basic `intellisense` out here.
- intellisense 智能感知;智能提示;智能感应;智能感知功能

Right Click to create File.

If we right click and Click Reveal in 
File Explorer, Index.html file is here.

The second important thing we should 
be knowing is how to use Terminal?

There is a something called as 
Terminal, click on New Terminal.

A terminal is a command prompt from 
which we can `fire commands` like  

we can write commands like directory and can 
see all files, can fire node commands and so on.


Run the terminal and run commands.

The next step is to install Node.js, google 
nodejs and open first link nodejs.org.

Do not worry about what nodejs, NPM, 
Typescript just focus on the installation part.  

Once the installation is right later on I will 
explain all of these concepts `very much in-depth`.

There are two downloads one is recommended for 
Most Users and another one is the Latest Features.

If you are `working on` Live projects,  

serious projects would suggest to use the 
one which is recommended for Most Users.

This is stable version, it has been time 
tested, bugs have been removed and so on.

If you are doing some kind of a hobby 
project, want to test new features then  

install the latest feature but please note 
that there is `probability` it can have bugs.

Because we are learning and I 
want to make sure this course  

stays for long time install the current feature.

Will install current latest feature, 
install this 18.0.0 , please note at  

this moment the version is 18.0.0 
later it can be 20 `or whatever`.

Whatever I am teaching here at this moment in 
Angular, those things won't change as such.

If you think something has changed send 
email at questpond@questpond.com , will  

tell you how to go about those new things. 

Will download this, it’s 
downloading right down below.

See the installation again of nodejs 
is pretty straight forward there is  

nothing we don’t have to do anything big 
out here it is just a smooth next next next.

I accept next you can change the directive 
but at this moment I will just keep it  

‘c’ program files nodejs. You can 
change the directory if you wish.

Atomically install this tools like chocolaty so 
on, will keep it unchecked say next and install.

There it goes and node js has 
been successfully installed. 

Now check that if our node installation 
has been done properly or not.  

I will first search out here node I should be 
able to find this small app in here installed.

It says in here version 18.0.0 which is 
right that is version I had installed. 

The other thing which I would 
recommend you to also check is  

go and run the command prompt run the command 
prompt in admin mode, run vs code admin mode.

It is the most important thing, lot of those 
issues of admin rights it’s will get resolved if  

you do this. Lot of issues of installation can 
be overcome if you just run as administrator.

Let us check the version of node node -v in 
case you not able to see this let me go and  

make the fonts larger right there it is.
It is showing version 18.0.0 

One of the other things what we need for 
angular is NPM - Node Package Manager. Node  

package manager gets installed with node.
With node this npm will get installed.  

Check if the npm model also installed 
there it is you can see we also have npm. 

The version of npm is different 
than node this is very important. 

Don’t think that the npm and the node version 
will be same because they have the same software  

but they are different actually.
node is on 18.0.0 and npm version is on 8.6.0 

This actually confirms that your node has be 
installed properly. The other thing is go to  

vs code and just check the node from vs code as 
well from the terminal. Lunch this terminal out  

here - Terminal New Terminal and let us check 
can we run the node command from here node-v 

Here it saying oh like I don’t understand node. 
The term node is not recognized this and this. 

First things if you see at the 
righthand side it says PowerShell.  

I would suggest to not use PowerShell but use a 
simple command. I will delete this command prompt. 

## todo

And delete this terminal and 
switch to simple command prompt. 

There are two command prompt one is a PowerShell. 
I will talk about PowerShell later on. But at  

this moment to make sure that node is installed we 
don’t need this PowerShell command prompt. We need  

a simple cmd the cmd which we ran from outside 
that’s what we need. Let us check out here node -v  

if it is running then it is good.
Again it is showing exception  

saying that no I don’t recognize it 
that means there is something else. 

When I installed node my vs code was 
open, I did it on purpose actually. 

I will close this and restart my vs code.
Run as admin I am still repeating it for the good  

of everyone, I will just say run as administrator.
There is cmd out here, let us do a clear screen  

cls and say node-v. You can see our commands 
are running npm -v our commands are running. 

You can also run this through PowerShell but 
sometime you know for some reasons it does  

not run for example even the node command will 
run from PowerShell right but I would recommend  

that stick to cmd because PowerShell is actually 
for something else. We will talk about that later  

on but try to be on cmd rather than on PowerShell.
This confirms that our node is installed  

our npm is working and it is 
working in a integrated manner.  

We can fire the node commands from vs code. 
This confirms that our node, npm installation  

and vs code installation is just perfect.
We have now installed vs code we have installed  

node we have checked the version of node and 
npm now it is time to install angular CLI. 

Again clear screen out here and let me do a 
Control + to make sure that you can see the screen  

clearly. Control + to make the fonts bigger and 
control - to make the fonts smaller in vs code. 

Intall the CLI will say npm 
install , npm is a part node  

right –g @angular front / CLI and Press Enter
This takes a little bit of time to install because  

the size of the CLI is a little bit big 
depending on your internet connection it can  

take 1 minute to 2 minute to 5 minutes as well.
It is getting installed, now if everything  

goes good you should not see any red sign.
At this moment I am saying some warnings but  

that is absolutely fine. I am not seeing in red 
sign I am just saying some blue sign out here  

or maximum you can see there warnings.
If you see red sign then that’s a concern.  

Added 196 packages audited them 
as well and everything looks good. 

I again I clear screen out here now in order 
to check if our CLI has been installed we will  

fire the command ng ng this ng comes from that 
angular, in the word of angular we have that  

ng that’s why you know they kept the CLI name 
as ng the command of the CLI is ng version 

We should see the version of 
CLI. The version of CLI is 13.3.4  

your node version is 18.0.0 and npm version is 
8.6.0 and it has installed some angular semantics. 

This is the most important Part just make sure 
that you have this version of the CLI, this  

version of the node and this version of the npm.
Definitely in the coming months  

they are going to be higher versions whatever 
I am recording at this moment is very much true  

for the coming higher versions as well.
In case if there is any changes I will  

send and updated recording for it.
These 3 versions if they are all ok  

if you’re able to fire ng version command that 
means your angular CLI has installed properly. 

Remember that you can use the up-arrow 
key and the down arrow key to get the  

previous command which you are fired in vs code.
You can see here I am getting all my previous  

command which you have fired in my vs code up 
arrow key and down arrow key will help you to  

get the command.
Now that  

we have installed the node we have installed CLI.
It’s now time to test if we can create our  

simple angular application, type this command 
ng new test (project name) and press enter. 

You would now be prompted with couple of questions 
out here don’t worry about these questions. 

When we start learning angular I will 
go through each one of these options for  

now just press enter, enter and enter.
If everything is goes nice and do not  

get any errors at the left hand side a test 
folder has been created and you should see  

such kind of a folder structure test src. Down 
below it is showing installing packages npm. 

If everything is good then this installing of 
the packages everything works fine and you should  

see that your command prompt or console or the 
terminal over here should not show any red signs. 

Now everything has been installed successfully 
it says packages installed successfully.  

Everything is green if you see anything red out 
here that means there is a problem. In case when  

you have a problem what you have to do is when 
in your actually interacting with us on the email  

you have to first tell us what is your 
node version and what is your CLI version  

this actually Clarifies lot of things 
why your project not getting created. 

Most of the errors what 
will get out here is because  

there is a mismatch between the node version and 
the CLI version which you are trying to install. 

Now the project has ran let us do a 
directory. Directory actually shows us all  

the folders you can see the folder test out here.
The next thing is to run the final command and run  

the angular application will say change directory 
test this is a very important step whatever  

project name you have created you will say cd test 
you will go inside that folder and you will fire  

the command ng serve. ng serve command will run 
these angular applications and make sure that  

your installation is complete.
You can see I have done ng serve  

and it has made the application live in this 
4200 port now please note that at this moment. 

When I did the ng serve command it was 
quite but depending on your configuration  

and speed of your machine it can take some time.
Run Google chrome and paste  

this url out here http://localhost:4200 .
You can get this url from  

this console out here in case not you can type 
it out http:localhost:4200/ enter. And if you  

see this screen out here this is the sign that 
you’re installation of your angular this complete. 

Now couple of important things do remember you 
defiantly get errors right couple of important  

things remember first think when you actually 
go and fire the commands from the terminal. 

Make sure that you are on cmd you are 
using cmd basically when you actually  

and say new terminal right make sure 
that you are adding a command prompt. 

You are running your ng commands 
through a command prompt and not  

through a PowerShell if you are running through 
PowerShell then you can get shorten errors. 

Like you know for example if I do ng new xyz you 
can see there I am getting this error out here  

saying that C users shiv ng.ps1 cannot be loaded.
The file is not digitally signed and so on and it  

saying that please set your execution policy in 
case you want to fire from PowerShell remember. 

What is PowerShell, PowerShell is nothing 
but it is scripting language which can  

be Use by administrates to automate task.
For example let us say you want to go and  

backup profile regularly every evening you 
want to go and restart the computer right. 

The administrates can wright PowerShell 
Scripts and they can run those scripts  

through to PowerShell command.
In case if you are on PowerShell  

right then if you get those errors you can see I 
am actually having a stackoverflow link out here. 

This stackoverflow link is also there 
present in the nodes as well over here  

then couple of things you can do is 
you can either go or remove the ng.ps1 

From that roaming folder or what 
you can do is that you can run  

the PowerShell through this 
allebated command basically  

you will actually go and the execution policy.
Of the PowerShell command you will actually  

allebated right I am go and do this I will 
say clear screen and you can see here. 

Even the ng version any commands of ng 
don’t work anymore right I am go and  

paste and run this once you run it right now 
I should be able to get ng version let us see. 

There it is it is working now right in 
case if you are getting this error out  

here the one of the things what you can do 
is you can go and you can run this command. 

Set execution policy or what you can do is you 
can go and you can remove this ng.ps1 and you can  

do and npm clear cash also if you want right.
That again probably can work these are the  

2 solution which you can implement in 
case you are getting errors out here. 

But I would say the best you should on run 
the command if you know through command prompt  

through the normal cmd to avoid this issues right.
But in case you ruining from PowerShell  

that’s make sure that you are ruining the set 
execution policy or you try the ng.ps1 delete. 

Let us summarise the installation first one you 
have to go and you have to install node second  

thing you will go and you will install the CLI.
We will say npm install angular CLI npm install  

–g @angular/CLI once this is done we 
will go and we will do ng new test  

you will go inside the test folder.
And say ng run and once is do ng run  

right you should be able to 
see your angular application. 

if you see angular application 
running that means that  

your angular installation is proper and complete.
Let us try to understand what exactly is nodejs 

If you go to node js.org you will see this one 
statement or slogan which they have written  

nodejs is a JavaScript runtime built 
on chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. 

We all know Chrome browser which come from 
Google in that we have a very strong compiler or  

interpreter which is the V8 JavaScript engine.
And this V8 JavaScript engine  

is superfast because it basically takes JavaScript 
and it generates bytecode from the syntax. 

This is very important this bytecode 
is compiled to machine code. 

If JavaScript gets compile to machine code it 
can run superfast and that’s why the engine  

name is V8. This V8 is not version 8 but 
this V8 signifies like a 8 cylinder engine. 

We have like 2 cylinder engine We have 
like 4 cylinder engine in automobiles. 

And here we are taking about 8 Cylinder 
engine that means this is 8 cylinder  

engine superfast compiler which actually 
compiles the JavaScript to machine code. 

If you see all these statement by the V8 team 
out here looks like they are fan of automobiles. 

You can see the ignition generates bytecode 
and then the turbofan compile this bytecode  

and this V8 which actually is 
the superfast 8 stroke engine. 

That means the best compiler or the best 
interpreter for JavaScript is with chrome. 

The nodejs team took this 
chrome V8 engine only the chrome  

V8 JavaScript engine and created a separate setup.
And that’s what the setup we have just installed.  

You can think about this nodejs is not 
exactly like a wrapper but definitely the  

heart of nodejs is the V8 engine.
The one which we have downloaded  

in our computer right during the installation 
process it is the superfast V8 JavaScript engine. 

The next question comes is than what will happen 
now we have installed it what happens now? 

That means we can now run JavaScript outside 
the browser because we have the V8 engine or  

the JavaScript engine installed in the 
computer which is in a form of nodejs 

That means we can run 
JavaScript outside the browser,  

we can create desktop applications we can 
create server side applications and so on. 

And one important point which I want to stress 
out here is when it comes to debug in JavaScript  

99.99 % developers I have seen use chrome to 
debug JavaScript and one of the reasons why  

they use chrome to debug JavaScript because of 
this V8 JavaScript engine. It is so strong it  

can compile to bytecode and so on.
If you see most of the time  

developers actually swear by chrome 
when it comes to debugging in JavaScript  

they go to the sources tab, click on this debug 
tab and they debug inside chrome why because  

the V8 engine is very promising.
Let us do a small demo of nodejs  

with that we understand that how node js helps 
to you run JavaScript outside the browser. 

In the same learn angular folder delete 
this two files what we have here. 

This was the test folder which was created. This 
was just to test that for installations proper. 

Do a sift delete out here and delete 
this complete two folders out here. 

Create a simple JavaScript file here will 
just say test.js and in this write some  

JavaScript codes var x=0 and control + and I 
will say console.log (x) and we can just do an  

x ++ . Here I have this JavaScript code out 
here you can see now the files got deleted. 

How VS Code strikes this index.html indicating 
that this file is not available, will close it.  

Left hand side everything is clear.
I have this simple  

JavaScript file here test.js and let us say we 
want to now run this without opening the browser. 

We can say here node Test.js and you can see 
it has ran the code out here it has incremented  

x to 1 and it is displaying in the console.log
This example looks very simple but you can feel  

the Power of JavaScript ruining offline and 
once JavaScript can run outside the browser  

you can create desktop applications you can create 
server applications and so many other things. 

One small question out here which I want 
to ask everyone if you know the answer  

you can either go and send me massage privately 
or either you can put down in a comment section  

that basically why I did not use here 
document.write ? why I did not use here  

alert ? Why I did use console.log ?
If you know the answer, please  

send a massage to me or if you want you can go 
ahead and put down in the comment section as well. 

Node programming is a very different big word all 
together and when you say you want to work with  

angular you don’t need node programming as such.
We will not be doing node programming but when you  

install node we get something called 
as npm i.e. a node package manager. 

We need to understand that very well npm we are 
going to use day and night whenever doing angular. 

What is NPM?
Npm stands for node package manager it helps to  

you install JavaScript package in your computer.
if you want to install Jquery say here npm  

install Jquery. Once you say npm install Jquery in 
your command line it will fetch Jquery from online  

and install it in your local machine.
You can see here at the left-hand side  

it has created a folder node_modules and 
it has installed Jquery in your machine. 

If you don’t have npm go to online you have to 
go Jquery wherever it is get that Jquery file  

then you can use it in your project. Let us say 
I want to install let us say lodash and enter. 

It will fetch online it will take a 
latest version of lodash and install  

it in your node_modules folder you can see 
this node_modules folder is a reserved folder  

the name is node_modules , all small letters.
You can see here it has installed Jquery  

as well as it has installed lodash inside the 
folder now what you can do let us say if you  

want to use Jquery then you can go to the dist 
folder and you can get your Jquery.js from here  

now remember that whenever you doing npm install 
it actually brings the whole github source code. 

The complete source code of that open 
source it will bring to your local  

machine you can see here it has fetch the 
whole Jquery with not only the source code  

but also the finally compiled js as well right.
If you want to use Jquery in your project you will  

say index.html and at this moment Jquery 
final compile Jquery is available here  

in the dist folder Jquery.js
As a developer you can say Script you can src and  

you can just say ../node_modules/ and go to 
Jquery go to dist and take your Jquery.js 

These are your packages and 
this is your source code. 

Now you will also find a file 
here called has package.Json 

What is this package.json file ?
This package.json file has  

the list of dependencies which you 
have installed in your project folder. 

This is your project folder now learn 
angular. In case you want to directive  

open folder through VS code right click and 
say reveal in file explorer. If you do that  

you can see here folder opened out here. 

Inside this project folder whatever dependencies, 
packages are install in the node_modules  

is present in the package.json now what 
happen is in a practically is that you always  

check in into your source control in your 
source control you will only checking  

the source code you are source code of the 
application and package.json you won’t be checking  

node_modules you never checking java run time 
or .net run time in to your source control. 

You only checking the source 
code and the dependencies. 

Let us say you go to new machine out there 
and you get latest the source code and you  

get latest the package.json file and then 
you have to only go and say npm install. 

Once you do npm install it will bring 
all these dependencies into node_module 

If i do an npm install it 
will go package by package and  

bring these 2 packages into your node_module
package.json has a list of dependencies  

of your project folder.
The last important prerequisite  

before we start learning angular is typescript 
you can see here i have google typescript  

and it actually lands up on this first page out 
here and if i click on this typescript out here  

it takes us to the typescript home page or to the 
typescript's official website typescriptlang.org 

If you see this one big slogan typescript which 
they have written here is typescript is nothing  

but it is javascript basically typescript 
is a language and that language when it gets  

compiled or it gets converted i will say rather 
or transpiled it gets converted to javascript with  

strongly type with syntax for types.
Typescript is a strongly typed  

programming language that builds on 
javascript. Let us try to understand it 

JavaScript is a loosely typed language in other 
words it does not care about the data types. 

You can change the data type during 
the runtime for example. This small  

test.js which we had written previously in line 
number one when you say var x=0 it is a number  

but you can see in line number three when 
i say x= some text , this becomes a string. 

JavaScript allows this JavaScript does not 
complain about this in line number one it  

will be a number x variable will be a number 
and in line number three x will be a text  

and javascript will not complain about it you 
can just go and run test.js and it's all okay. 

It has displayed x it has not complained nothing.
Javascript is a dynamic language the datatypes  

can change during the runtime.
Definitely you know dynamic languages  

have their own positive points you know they have 
their own strong points right but there is another  

group of developers who believe in strongly 
typed language in strongly typed language  

once you create a variable and you define a 
datatype you cannot change that data type. 

For example here in line number three if somebody 
says x++ this can be problematic i mean like you  

can't increment a text as such because this 
increment operator is mostly on numbers. 

What happens here is you see you can you get 
some unwanted results like NaN not a number  

definitely one of the strong points of dynamic 
language is that you can code faster you can  

deliver faster it is dynamic it is like cool, 
breeze but at the same time the way it is  

cool right if you don't pay attention you can 
have bugs, you can have unwanted side effects. 

There is a another group of thought of people 
or thought of developers who say that no  

we understand that dynamic languages are good 
but we want it to be a strongly typed language  

we want that the datatype should be checked 
while we write the code and we shouldn't be  

allowed to change this data type this should 
actually throw up an exception that's where  

actually typescript comes into picture.
Typescript says that i will give  

this strongly tightness to javascript.
Typescript makes your javascript strongly typed. 

Let us see how to go and install typescript 
so if you go out here. Either you can go  

and you can play on the browser and another 
one is you can use npm on your computer via npm  

we can go and we can install typescript 
we can say here npm install typescript. 

Let us install typescript i am going to go to 
my local machine out here and say npm install  

typescript  

there it is you can see it has 
installed typescript in my local folder. 

Here I would like to install typescript globally,  

I can just fire the commands easily 
or else what i have to do now is  

i have to go to the bin directory i have 
to go and get this exe from here right  

let us go ahead and install typescript globally.
I'll just say install typescript  

typescript-g , -g means global I can 
just fire the typescript command right  

from here in the command prompt or I have to 
go inside this folder and fire the commands. 

Let us go and check the version of typescript 
tsc-v there it is you can see it has installed  

the 4.6. version which is the latest version.
If you want to do coding in typescript you have  

to go and create a .ts extension we can go 
and we can say learn 1.ts you can see now  

this is typescript with the .ts extension 
now i can go and i can define a variable  

and as we said that typecript is a strongly typed 
language i can go and i can define it's data type. 

I'm saying that this x1 is a number when i say 
this x1 is a number and if i try to give it a text  

lets say in line number two if i try to give it 
a text out here you can see that there is a small  

red wriggle out here and if you move your mouse 
on that red wriggle it is saying that no this is  

not allowed x1 is already a type number and you 
are trying to assign a string and typescript is a  

strongly typed language and it will not allow it.
Typesacript is javascript with syntax for types.  

What does it mean that typescript is javascript ?
For example here now let us say  

i go and i say x1++.
I can go and i can convert  

this typescript to javascript i can go here 
and say that tsc remember that is a compiler  

and if you say learn 1.ts compile this ts.
What it does is it actually goes and creates a  

learn 1.js i will not say it's compiled, compiled 
means basically to deal with assembly languages  

when you compile to machine code i'll say that 
the convert or transpile is the right word it has  

taken this .ts file out here and transpiled it to 
js you can see it has made a javascript out of it. 

remember that this typescript is only during the 
coding phase it is only for developers who love  

strongly tightness strongly typed a strongly 
typed kind of an environment for them typescript  

is there right but at the end of the day when 
you say you want to run inside the browser  

it has to be javascript that's why this typescript 
compiler converts this ts into javascript. 

Now this sentence would make a lot of 
sense typescript is javascript first point 

and second but it gives you that feeling of 
strong tightness and with that you know you  

will have less bugs with that you know you would 
feel comfortable specially people who are coming  

from C++ and C Sharp and java where they feel that 
strongly tightness is important to catch the bugs  

early to do not have any kind of unwanted side 
effects for them typescript gives like a cover on  

javascript and gives that strongly typed feeling.
If you look at the definition of typescript again  

there is one important word out here which says 
that it gives you better tooling at any scale  

cale means that you know basically it 
increases the productivity of the developer. 

If you look at javascript right javascript is a 
functional programming language it isa functional  

language and if you look at look around but devs 
who come from C++ who come from C sharp who come  

from java and so on most of them are object 
oriented programmers at least i feel so 80%  

of the devs love objective programming they 
understand classes they can write better code by  

using those concepts of objective programming like 
polymorphism inheritance encapsulation abstraction  

they use interfaces and abstract clases and so on 
right suddenly when you tell them ok go ahead and  

have you know the same productivity and 
write the code in javascript functions  

it becomes difficult for a person who is 
doing functional programming it is little  

bit difficult to get into object-oriented 
programming and a developer who is doing  

object-oriented programming it is very 
difficult for him to perform at that same scale  

when it comes to functional programming so what 
typescript says that says don't worry go ahead  

write your classes do inheritance do polymorphism 
write interfaces write abstract classes and i will  

ensure that i will compile it or i will rather 
say transpile it and convert it to javascript. 

Yyou can write your class let us say customer 
and now let's say a customer has a property name. 

Remember one very important thing in typescript 
first the name of the variable and then the type. 

Normally what we do we say like int i 
but in case of javascript it is first  

i number first the name and name of the variable 
and then the data type i'll say your name string  

then i will say code string. 

I can also go and perform inheritance i can 
say customer child extends customer i can do  

inheritance i can write interfaces. Here i'm 
trying to just make you understand that it  

increases the productivity of the developer as 
well. If i go and if i compile this learn 2.ts  

and if you go and if you just 
see this learn2.js see that  

it's writing functions it is writing closures it 
is using IIFE you don't have to worry about those  

prototype and so on right so all of that is all 
taken care of that you can see this is a function  

inside the function it is a closure i will 
not go into closures now i will not go into  

IIFE i will not go into prototype but 
the point i'm trying to make here is that  

you don't have to worry about it actually.
Typescript takes care of all that  

and second you know it goes one step ahead for 
example now let us say i have this learn 3.ts  

because one of the other things what the object 
oriented programmers like is they want to create  

modules as well let us say you have this one 
file here learn2.ts which has customer class  

and let us say that the learn3.ts has an 
address class assumed let us say this is  

address out here what you can do is 
that you can go ahead and you can say  

export you can have these two files 
separate modular you can say export  

and in this learn2.ts you can say import 
you can say ok go ahead and import  

from that learn3.ts go and import address class 
from is you can see your address and then i can  

say ok one customer this one customer can have 
multiple addresses i can create your an addresses  

array a collection of address. 

You can also create modular code you can write 
object-oriented programming code you can write  

modular code and you don't have to worry you 
just say compile this learn2.ts, it will just  

go ahead and compile it if you just see here 
you can see now very smartly what he has done is  

learn2.ts is using learn3.ts look at the 
smartness. It goes and tries to compile  

learn2.ts and he says like learn2.ts is 
using learn3.ts it also compiles learn3.ts 

You can see he has compiled3.ts 
he has also compiled learn2.js and  

you can see that he has also used the address 
class inside this customer class out here. 

You can see that is address out there which 
is pointing towards the customer.Address 

By using the import and export 
you can create nice modular  

physically separate files as well and finally they 
get compile to functional javascript very easily. 

Going back that definition - Typescript is 
javascript yes but it is strongly typed the  

types are checked during the resign time and 
most important it gives you a nice artificial  

layer on which the developers can go and write 
classes can they do object-oriented programming  

they can create Modular code you know by using 
the import and export and typescript will ensure  

that it will convert it to javascript.
When the typescript compiler compiles  

the typescript file to javascript i'm not sure 
that if i should use this word compile because  

compile means you take a machine take a higher 
level language or you take a code and you compile  

it to machine language here actually we are 
converting typescript to javascript we can say  

transpile must be transpile vocabulary 
would be a better word than compile. 

When typescript gets transpiled to javascript 
right it's a quite complex process. 

As a developer we would like to go and take charge 
of this process we would like to customize it  

we would like to provide configurations 
we would like to provide parameters for  

example - i would like to go and provide 
configuration saying that in which version  

of javascript it should compile means it should 
use the es4 version es5, es6 or which version  

of es javascript should get compiled ?
in order to go and control this compilation  

process or configure this compilation process 
typescript team has provided the tsconfig.json  

file let us go ahead and create the tsconfig.json 
file for that we have to say tsc--init  

what this command will do is this will 
create a tsconfig.json file you can see here  

he has created a tsconfig.json file now in 
this you can see there are lots of compiler  

options which are given out here like you 
want to compile into which es version. 

Let us try to use one of them, whenever the 
compilation happens whenever the transpilation  

happens put all the javascript into this output 
directory called has dist distribution folder. 

Whenever i go and i compile this typescript it is 
actually throwing the js in the same folder right  

must be we would like to go and 
put it into a separate folder. 

I have provided in the tsconfig.json 
file saying that the output directory  

should go the output directory is disk now what 
happens is if we now say tsc now you don't have  

to go and compile the individual files.
Wherever the tsconfig.json file is you  

have to just hit tsc it will take all the 
ts files and it will try to transpile it  

into the disk directory you can see now it 
has put all the files into the dist folder. 

There are some errors out here but that's fine i 
thnk you can see that there is an error out here  

in learn2.ts very interesting 
and in this learn2.ts 

The error says that null is not assignable to 
address this is interesting you can see that how  

typescript is taking control 
over the compilation process. 

For example here if i provide here new array 
of address this error will not happens if i  

go and if i do this , this error will not happen.
If I now hit again tsc you can see nothing happens  

here now what is this actually now here when you 
actually specify null in this tsconfig.json file  

it is doing a strict check here basically 
there is something called as a strict check. 

A strict check is nothing but typescript 
goes and says that it will strictly check  

if you are using nulls if you are doing 
any kind of weird things it will try to  

make it as an error it will try to warn you.
Over here if I disable that strict check to false  

and somewhere there should be strict check strict 
there it is you can see it is saying type checking  

strict equal to true what you would like to do is 
you would like to say that see like yes i would  

like to use the strongly tightness but at the same 
time don't stop me from using nulls because nulls  

are important in many cases right because nulls 
define an absence of something i would like to  

use nulls i would like to have my own freedom.
You can provide you're saying false if you do  

that then you won't get the exception anymore now 
the typescript compiler will say ok you said that  

i shouldn't be doing a strict check when i do 
a tsc no error out there right basically this  

tsconfig.json file has lots of configurations 
and you can go and you can control and customize  

the typescript transpilation process now remember 
that you can see many many configurations out here  

i won't suggest to start going through 
them now itself you know because that  

you would actually lose your stamina.
You can do late learning means whichever  

properties are needed we will look into it when 
we do angular when we start with angular coding  

there are some three or four 
properties, we need them on regular  

basis at the time we will discuss about it so.
For now you don't have to really go into each  

one of these properties and try to understand them 
but yes basically overall you have to understand  

that if you want to go and provide configuration 
and if you want to go and customize your  

transpilation process you can go and you can 
provide those configuration into tsconfig.json  

and typescript compiler will take the 
configurations from this json file. 

Now that we have learned so much about typescript 
a small quiz on typescript who created typescript  

and just as a hint i have flashed the hero 
of typescript on the screen he is a danish  

nationality he works for Microsoft right and 
look at our hero i mean like he has created  

so many programming language that's really the 
inspiration for us you can see that he has created  

turbo pascal, delphi, C# and now typescript.
Age does not matter isn't it so if  

you love programming keep coding.
If you know the answer then please put down  

in the comments below who created typescript.
Now in order to create a project in angular,  

angular developers don't create it manually. 
They don't go and create a tsconfig.json file  

and a package.json file they don't do it manually 
they use something called as the angular CLI this  

angular CLI comes from the angular team 
the CLI stands for command line interface  

once you install the angular CLI you 
get nice commands out there by which  

you can create the angular project very easily.
I've already explained in the installation part  

how to go and install the angular CLI 
but just in case if you have missed it  

you can revisit it. Just quickly iterate over here 
i'll say if you want to install the angular CLI  

you will use npm, npm install angular CLI and if 
you want to install it globally you can just say  

-g which will install globally in your computer.
Now the CLI in installed in my computer in this  

virtual machine out here if i 
want to go and quickly check  

the version of angular CLI say ng version
this ng stands for the two letter word which  

comes In angular a n g u l a r that ng comes from 
that if I say ng version it will quickly give me  

which version of angular cli is installed 
in my machine you can see it is saying you  

have angular in angular cli 13 installed.
In case if new cli version have come in  

this tutorial is still valid because 
angular as such does not change so much  

in terms of the syntaxes right they are quite 
stable when it comes to changes of syntaxes. 

Now that you have the angular cli installed 
you can go and you can create a project. 

What my belief is that if you want to go and learn 
something then you should do a project some kind  

of project like customer management system or a 
travel management system or a hospital management  

system try to create a small screen with add 
button, with a update button try to complete  

a crud application if you try to complete 
a create application you can learn quickly  

you can learn to the point.
I’m going to go here and create  

a hospital management system I work day and night 
with the health care system with the healthcare  

domain I would be pretty happy to use to create 
a hospital system where in we will create a  

simple patient management screen where we can 
add patients we can edit patients and so on. 

But in case if you like some other 
domain please create project accordingly  

in order to create a project we will say 
here ng new and hospital management system. 

Now once you say ng new hospital management 
system it will ask you couple of questions  

the first question it is asking you is 
that do you want to use Angular routing? 

What is angular routing?
Angular routing is nothing but  

it helps you to navigate it helps you to define 
your navigation from one screen to another screen. 

When you say you want to navigate inside angular 
components inside angular UI that’s where you use  

angular routing it’s saying that I’m going to go 
and create this project template do you want to  

include angular routing why not yes definitely 
we are going to go and define hyperlinks  

we’ll be defining navigation yes we want this.
The next question which it’s asking is that  

which style sheet format are you using are you 
using css are you using scss and sass and less. 

Frankly the other three frameworks 
of css I’ve never used it and I’m  

sure that many people stick to the basic css.
We will go and we will select css in case if you  

want to use scss sass less press the down arrow 
key out there and you can select appropriately  

but for now you can use the down arrow key and 
up down arrow key to select these menus but for  

now I’m going to use css because that’s what 
I’ve used most of my time and I’ll say enter. 

Once you do that it will start creating the 
project if you see at this moment inside learn  

angular you can see hospital management system 
which is out here which is getting created  

and it has created this project out here and you 
can see it is the npm is installing the packages  

as well this will take some time give it some 
time you know until the installation completes. 

At the left hand side the hospital 
management system is created with the  

necessary code base out here by which 
we can start angular very quickly. 

Give some time and let the npm install 
all the packages and then we will proceed.  

If everything is good everything goes 
nice you will see everything green out  

here you can see everything is green and the 
project has been created at the left hand side  

but in case if you find if you see any issues 
then it should be shown in a red colour  

remember there is a green colour which says 
everything is okay there is an yellow colour  

which says there are warnings and developers don’t 
worry about warnings but if you see a red colour  

that means it is something alarming and you won’t 
be able to proceed at that time please send as  

a massage and we’ll try the to help you out.
Now one very important point to note here is  

that whenever we create a project by 
using ng new it creates it in a folder. 

I said ng new hospital management system it 
actually created inside created it inside  

a folder if you want to go and run this 
project you have to go inside this folder. 

For example I fired this command from this 
learn angular folder all the project is created  

inside the hospital management system.
Whatever you typed in ng new whatever name  

you give to your project it has created inside 
a folder if you want to go and run angular you  

have to go inside that folder to run the project
I will say change directory hospital management  

system let us go inside the project there it is.
And now here if you want to run this angular  

project you will say here ng serve what this 
ng serve does is it actually goes and compiles  

this project bundles it, does everything and runs 
your project on a mini web server on a 4200 port  

if I do an ng serve out here you can see 
it is generating the application bundles  

it bundles the application and it hosts it in 
this 4200 port out here you can just copy it  

we can just say control ‘C’ and 
we can run it in the browser. 

I will be using chrome to run and I would suggest 
everyone to use chrome because when it comes to  

debugging JavaScript chrome is the king of it.
If you run this there is your first project  

which is running great ng new to create the 
project and ng serve to run the project. 

Now some couple of mistakes which newcomers do lot 
of newcomers they try to run the ng serve command  

outside the project directory for 
example if you try to do an ng serve  

like this for example you can see here I am 
now outside then hospital management system  

if I try to run and try to do an ng serve 
out here I will get an error saying that  

I don’t see the angular this is not an angular 
project I don’t find any definitions and so on. 

This is very common error if you get this error 
that means that you are not inside the project  

directory go ahead and change to the hospital 
management system directory and then fire ng serve  

and couple of important tricks which you 
can remember out here you can use this up  

arrow key and down arrow key to get your old 
commands which you fired onto the terminal. 

All my old commands whatever I have fired into 
this terminal I get it. Use the up arrow key  

and the down arrow key to get the history of 
commands which has been fired into the terminal. 

I will go and I will say change hospital 
management system and if I do ng serve out  

here it will work but if you do ng serve 
where the project directory is not there  

it will give you this exception saying that the 
project definition has not could not be found. 

You can see here that it’s much noise because 
we are also seeing the typescript code out here. 

We want to only focus now on the hospital 
management system what I will do is  

I will go to the file explorer if you want to 
go to the folder where the hospital management  

system is you can right click and say reveal 
in file explorer and we will only open  

the hospital management system folder that we are 
focused on the angular project I’ll say file open  

folder and I wil just give the hospital management 
system that I don’t see the typescript code. 

You can see here now we are just seeing 
the hospital management system put here  

and this looks pretty neat and focused.
We don’t see other folders and we can  

we focused on the angular code out here.
Please note run your VS code in admin mode.  

Please ensure that you have proper writes and so 
on already in the installation I have talked about  

what kind of problems you can phase when you 
run the commands and the npm commands. 1:22:15 

Now that the project is created lets deep 
dive into it let us try to understand  

what files are present in this project where is 
the source code is and how to start with things. 

Before we move ahead a quick quiz  

name the creators of angular and name the 
first website created by the creators. 

If you know their names please pay them respect 
by typing their names in the YouTube section  

remember we are learning their creation and if 
you don’t do not pay them respect that’s not  

human right and just a hint there are were two 
developers and both of them worked in Google. 

Let us get started with all the 
different files which are present  

in this template out here let us 
first start with package .json file. 

If you look at the package.json file it has all 
the dependencies of angular and in this you can  

also see the angular version for example 
at this moment I’m using the 13th version. 

Please note that in case if you see a 14th version 
out here of if see a 15th version out here don’t  

worry this tutorial should still help you because 
angular team does not make breaking changes as  

such at this moment so this tutorial is still 
valid if you have the new angular version here. 

This tutorial should be still be 
valid and it should still work. 

The first thing if you see here in the package 
.json file we have the angular dependencies and  

by looking at these dependencies you can clearly 
understand that angular is a modular framework  

in other words the team has created separate 
separate modules out here let us say if you  

say compiler they are put in a separate module 
angular compiler if you talk about forms it’s  

in a separate section if you talk about routing it 
is a separate section and so on they have created  

modules the whole angular framework is modular.
All the dependencies in package.json file then you  

have the tsconfig.json file remember this is to 
configure Typescript and you have the angular.json  

file which is to configure the angular related 
configurations three important configuration file. 

One is the package.json file , 
tsconfig file, angular.json file 

In the previous part of the video I have also 
explained what exactly is package log.json file 

You can see this package log.json file where 
we can see the exact version which is installed  

by npm now you can also see that there are some 
spec files out here for example you can see this  

tsconfig.spec.json 

Whenever you see any kind of spec files 
out here if you go to src also right  

you will find there are some spec files 
these spec files are related to unit testing. 

Whenever we do unit will 
talk about the spec files. 

package.json for configuring the 
npms, the references, the dependencies 

ts config file to configure the typescript 
and angular.json file to configure the angular  

related things and the spec files in which 
you see out here are related to unit testing. 

Before we proceed right it is 
very important to understand  

some vocabularies which are used in the angular 
community with the word angular actually. 

There are two families of angular one is the 
angular 1.x family which is the old version  

you can see this is angularjs.org which is 
the official website for the old version  

and this is the new version the angular 2.x 
family, 2.x means 2.0 and then 4.x and then  

5.x and 6.x and now we have angular 13 
and we can have further angular as well. 

This is the new version of angular this is the 
old version of angular which is angular 1.x family  

and this is the new version of angular.
Now I have seen this when you actually  

go out there and when someone says 
angularjs when they say angularjs  

they are referring to the old version.
When they just say angular they  

are referring to the new version.
I do understand that the angular team has said  

to just call it angular but this vocabulary is 
still there in the market when I go corporates for  

training of for consultancy they say that we have 
angularjs which means the old version and this is  

the new version where they just say angular.
Developers have stopped calling Angular 4, 5,  

angular 6, angular 13 they just say angular which 
refers to the angular 2.x family and this one here  

is the old angular which is the angular 1.x family 
and also as a note you know remember that this  

angularjs which is angular 1.x family has come to 
support end in other words it’s an end of life. 

End of life does not mean that end of angular 
it means that they will not support angular 1  

i repeat that this end of life announcement 
is not for how do you say it is not for the  

angular 2.x family it is for angular 1 what 
it means is that the code of angular 1 still  

accessible in github everything is all 
out there but only that no issues will be  

address no pull request will be made and so on.
There is a discontinued support of angular 1  

and all the focus is now on angular 2 
family and let us now say angular 2 or  

angular 4 or angular 5 let us just say angular.
And at this moment when I am recording this video  

the new version of angular is 13 as I’ve already 
set that in case even if 14 comes in or 15 comes  

in this tutorial should be still be valid 
ts config for the typescript configuration  

package.json for the npm configuration 
angular.json file for the angular configuration,  

Tsconfig.spec file for the testing 
purpose for the unit testing  

and this node_modules folder we all know this 
node_modules folder has all the packages. 

Whatever packages are listed in 
the package.json file out here  

for example you can see angular 
animation and angular common. 

You will find that this is angular and then you 
have the angular animation you have the angular  

common you have the angular compiler whatever 
dependencies are listed in the package.json file  

all of them are installed 
in the node_modules folder. 

The most important folder as a developer as 
an angular developer for us is the src folder. 

This is where we have our source code 
this is where we write our source code  

99% times you will be working on this src folder.
If you see in this src folder there is an  

app folder and inside the app folder you 
can see there are certain files out here. 

You can see some html files You can see some .ts 
files You can see some .module.ts file this is  

where you’ll be spending your 99% time coding 
angular and creating applications and so on. 

Let us try to understand this 
app folder in more detail. 

Before we look into this src folder before 
we look into this app folder let’s revisit  

Angular team’s definition for angular.
I am on the official website of angular which  

is angular.io the official website of angular.
Here is a small article on what is angular and  

if you read this definition of angular out 
here angular is a development platform built  

on typescript and let us focus now on the first 
sentence you can see there are three points out  

here regarding the definition of angular 
but let’s focus on the first line out here  

angular is a component based framework 
for buildings scalable web applications. 

Component - a component in angular is the base it 
is a fundamental on which angular stands. It’s the  

basic building block what will do is let us go and 
focus on this component you can see here in this  

src folder where we actually will be writing 
our source code this app.component.ts where  

you can see the component.
Let us focus on this fundamental on  

this base on which angular stands the component.
A component is a reusable UI logic which can be  

loaded inside html which can 
be loaded inside a browser 

It comprises of two things 
one is it comprises of a view  

which will be html view or you can see an UI part 
and other is at the back end it will have logic. 

This logic will be normally JavaScript and 
because we are writing in typescript we  

are using typescript but finally that 
will also get compiled to JavaScript. 

A component consists of a 
ui + logic in JavaScript. 

This is a component out here this is the 
class this is where we can write the logic  

and this is the html. A component comprises of 
logic+ view html a component comprises of logic  

this is the logic this file has a logic App 
component.ts and definitely this logic will  

then get complied to js because ts has to get 
compiled to js and the ui part is in the html. 

If you see out here this is what a component 
is and this component is connected with the ui  

and this is the ui.
Here now you can go  

in angular and you can write some 
ui logic for example let us say  

I’m going to go and write a input Type button 
let’s assume we write a simple logic here like  

input type button and when you click on 
this button I’ll just say value click  

and will say here click call some logic at the 
back end call some logic and this logic we write  

in the backend component.ts this is the ui.
At the back end in this class we will go  

and we will write this call some logic at this 
moment let us just go and display alert hello. 

And very important out here you can see 
that this class is connected with this html  

by using this template url thing and 
will discuss about this later on. 

This is the ui and this is the logic 
that’s what is a component in angular. 

This if we run ng serve  

there our ui is a running if I click on this 
you can see the backend logic ui + logic  

a component is ui + logic now one of the doubts 
which can come into your mind is that what makes  

this simple typescript class a component ?
Point no 1 to remember first point remember  

typescript does not have a 
concept called as component. 

The goal of typescript to make JavaScript strongly 
typed to give you an object oriented feeling and  

so on and increase productivity as such you 
know type to does not have a concept called  

as component this component concepts comes from 
angular you can see here this import out here  

which is actually getting 
imported from angular core. 

And this angular core is one of the modules 
which is shipped with the angular if you go  

to your package.json file you will find that 
this is one of the sub modules of angular. 

This component is a concept of angular 
and what makes this class a component  

this thing at the top of the class 
this is termed as a decorator. 

This @component is termed as a decorator and 
you can see that there are three things out here  

selector templateUrl and styleUrl.
Template URL connects with the html  

you can see this template url says this 
component is connected with which html  

style url says this component 
is connected with which css and  

finally this component which is nothing but 
the combination of html + css + this logic. 

What we are writing out here if you want to 
go and if you want to load it inside an html  

we use a selector this whole component which 
is a combination of all this html and + CSS  

and the logic if you want to load inside another 
html then you will use this selector, this name. 

You will see like this app root / app root 
then what will happen inside that html  

this html + this logic in on + CSS everything 
get loaded inside this html out here decorator  

component decorator this is a decorator 
this @component is a decorator  

let us again go ahead and just revise and 
reiterate what we talked about the component. 

I am repeating the same things again 
and again it is becoming mundane  

but I feel that this part is so important 
for a newcomer who comes into angular  

that if this part is missed out then I 
feel then the whole angular is missed out. 

We have this component.
The component  

has a view, it has the logic plus It has 
this logic + it can have CSS + it can have  

some other class as well this component 
can create an instance of an http object. 

This component can create an instance 
of logger object basically when you talk  

about a component a component comprises of 
view + logic + CSS + some other logic like  

components let’s say classes like logger + 
http you can thing about this component is like  

a mediator I can say connector or like a traffic 
police who actually gets all the things together  

and creates a wonderful reusable piece 
which you can go and call inside your html. 

Go back to the code and here this is the 
view this is the component and remember  

if you want to call this component inside an 
html you will call it by this name app-root. 

app-root is the name of the component 
if you see here in the index.html  

this app root has been called this means that he 
is trying to load this component inside this html. 

The selector out there is nothing but the name 
of the component. Component comprises of view CSS  

logic and this logic can be called inside the 
html by the selector this is the selector out here  

and this one here @component is a decorator.
Because of this decorator this simple  

typescript class becomes a component or 
else if this decorator is not out there  

then this is just a simple typescript class.
That thing at top makes this app component  

a component and this component is coming from 
where from the Angular.core and this Angular.core  

is at this moment installed inside your 
node_modules there it is angular.core  

and it got installed because in the package.json 
file you have it as one of the sub modules. 

The component @component decorator 
logic is there in this angular core. 

In this same way if let us say we want to 
do the bindings and we will using the forms  

and if you want to go and do routing 
will be using router an so on. 

That installation was done when you did 
npm install component, decorator, selector  

calling of the component is like this app 
root these are the basic building blocks. 

Of angular one more important thing which I want 
to talk here is the directives what is a directive  

a Directive is nothing but it is angular 
code or I will say angular syntax which you. 

Write inside html and if you look at the official 
definition of directive directive is nothing but  

it changes the behaviour of an 
html element you can see this. 

Click out here this click out here is an angular 
syntax this click out here is an angular syntax  

please note this is not the on click our 
JavaScript event is on click this is. 

Not the on click this is a click 
with a round bracket so this is  

actually an angular code when you see an angular 
code inside the html is is termed as a directive. 

And this directive what is does it actually goes 
and changes the behaviour of an html element for  

example this button out here was a simple 
button but now it has behaviour of a click. 

Because you have put a click directive putting 
in simple words directive is nothing but it is  

angular syntax which you write inside html.
Now one more important vocabulary I want to  

talk here is template normally you 
will hear this word angular template  

angular template is nothing but an angular UI.
This app.component.html is a template  

angular template is nothing but 
it is an html file which has  

directives which has angular syntaxes inside it.
You can call this as appcomponent.html  

but mostly inside the angular community they 
wil call it as a directive whenever you will  

see they will call it as a template.
Whenever you will see that you angular  

developers talk about this template URL 
they will say that this is a template  

just trying to summarize.
All the vocabularies out here  

a component is nothing but it comprises of 
logic + view a selector helps us to call  

this component selector is the name.
Of the component this @component  

it is a decorator which actually makes this 
normal typescript class a component and  

inside the html whenever you write.
Any kind of angular syntax it is nothing but  

a directive and this html out here is nothing but 
it is also called as a template there are in some. 

Of the vocabularies as we 
go ahead we’ll be using them  

the other important concept which we need 
to understand in angular is the module. 

What do we have now we have a component  

let us say you have a customer add component 
let us say you have a customer add component. 

And what does a component comprises of 
a component comprises of a view + logic  

this view is in html for now and 
this logic is written in typescript. 

In the same way probably you can have 
another component out here which again has  

a view + logic let us say that 
you have this component as. 

The customer reporting component this helps 
you to display customer reports now what you  

would like to do is you would like to go and 
put these components into a logical grouping. 

You would like go ahead and put them into a 
logical group this logical group is termed as  

a module must be you can go and give 
a name here saying customer module. 

A module an angular module helps you to 
logically group components I repeat this an  

angular module helps you to group components.
One module can have many components and in a  

project specifically in a complicated 
project you can have many modules like  

assume that this is a customer module out here.
Which has 2,3 components and then you can have  

one more module out here which is a supplier 
module you can have multiple modules in a project  

you can have a supplier module.
And it has supplier component 1  

supplier component 2 and so on in a project 
you can have multiple modules and every module  

logically groups components.
There you can see the code of a module  

this is a component this is the UI 
and this is the module the first thing  

what you will notice out here is that.
The way we had decorators for components  

for example when you take a simple class 
of typescript and you put a decorator of  

@component this becomes a component.
In the same way for module also if  

you take a simple class out there and if you 
decorate this Decorator of decorator ng module. 

This class becomes a module module and components 
are created because of this decorator out here  

and in this decorator for now focus on.
2 things 1 is the declaration and another one  

is bootstrap this declaration is where you will 
go and you will write your grouping of components. 

For example now let us say in your project you 
have two three components like app component  

and let us say if you have app component 
one assume how you have app component. 

At this moment we don’t have it and then you have 
add app component two you will go and you will  

write the grouping of the components over here.
You will say app component 1 app component 2  

and so on the grouping of the components you 
will group it in the declarations out here. 

Now from these components which are is the 
start-up component which will be the start-up  

component to run first you 
will define in the bootstrap. 

In declarations you will define the the grouping 
the logical grouping and in bootstrap you will  

define that from these components which 
component will run first which will be the. 

Bootstrap component great we 
have component we have a view  

and then it is logically grouped into 
Modules a module logically groups components. 

Let us try to visualize what we have learned till 
now and if you can understand this visualization  

you are an angular developer this is 
the most important part of lecture. 

If you’re able to visualize what I’m showing 
just now welcome you are an angular developer  

we said that we have a component 
a component comprises of a view. 

Let me try to draw this view a little bit 
big component comprises of a view and logic  

you can have many components  

and the grouping of component.
Is defined in a module  

the view and the logic is connected now this logic 
at the end of the day is a ts file a class file  

this view is an html.
Now this view and the logic  

is connected by the template URL remember we 
have a template URL which connects both of them  

inside the view you will have directives.
Inside the view you will have directives like  

we saw the click event you have directives 
you will have syntaxes of angular and  

you can have many such components.
We can have another module like this  

which is having other logical group of components  

now when the application runs when the 
application runs which of these modules. 

Will start first that is defined in the 
main.ts that is defined in main.ts In main.ts  

which module should run first 
is defined this is the module. 

This is the component well the component 
is a combination of this + this  

and we also have an index page here index.html  

the first UI to run is index.html.
index.html calls the main.ts the  

main.ts says ok this is the module and inside 
the module if you remember we had the bootstrap  

we had the bootstrap out here.
This bootstrap will say  

which component to run first this bootstrap 
will say which component to run first  

and that component will be loaded inside 
this index.html using the selector. 

If you remember we had this app root selector 
the name of the component inside this app root  

that component will run this is 
basically a visual diagram here. 

Let me go to the code that we can map both 
of them here it is index.html this runs first  

after that runs main.ts in the main.ts we are 
saying that the app module should run first. 

You can see now there are lots of code out here 
like platform browser dynamic don’t worry about it  

we’ll talk about it later on but I’m just saying.
That the main.ts runs after that  

the main.ts is this module is going to 
start the app module the app module says  

which component is going to start in bootstrap.
And then the component goes and takes up this html  

takes up this logic takes the whole 
thing and this is the selector app root  

and it loads this whole thing.
Inside the index.html right remember  

first index.html main.ts the component 
runs takes everything takes the UI + the  

logic and loads it inside the index.html.
Index.html main.ts module component loads  

inside the selector and remember that we have 
the directives which are written inside the UI. 

If you are able to get this visual diagram in your 
head congratulations you are an angular developer  

now the other important concept.
Which we need to understand as an  

angular developer is binding binding means you 
want to go and bind an input element you can see  

this is an input element a text box.
Let us say you want to bind this element  

to one variable often component let us say you 
have a variable out here let us say some value  

and when end user goes and types something.
On that text box you want that whatever is typed  

in this text box should come to this some value 
and when somebody changes something in this value  

it should go and display.
On the screen  

you want to go and do a binding for that we have 
a directive in angular which is ng model you can  

go and you can say your ng model M capital.
What is the name of your variable our name of  

a variable is some value again like remember 
in case typescript you will say variable. 

Name and then the data type you can 
see here some value colon string some  

value colon number some value colon Boolean.
We want to go and bind this text box with this  

some value you can see here ng model now 
you can also go and control how do you want  

this binding to happen.
Means when you look at a binding  

when look at a what you call a the binding 
flow the binding flow can be like this  

when you type on this text box you want that.
It should bw sent to this some value when  

there’s some value change you want that 
it should be sent to the UI as well. 

That means that you want a two way binding 
because you need two-way binding you will use  

two other sings out here the square 
bracket and the round bracket. 

What is does the square bracket 
signify the square bracket says that  

the data can come from the component to the 
UI this whenever the some value changes. 

You should also update the UI and this round 
bracket here signifies that the data can go from  

the UI to the component as well so remember the 
two-way binding here because we want a two- way 

Binding we want that the data should go from 
the UI to the component and from component  

to the UI that’s why I have put both of them the 
square bracket signifies that the data can come. 

From the component to the UI and the round 
bracket signifies that events can go from the  

UI to the component there it is.
Now you would like to also go and  

display this some value up there when you type 
on this text box it will go and it will change  

this some value and when the some value.
Changes you would like to go and display  

that on a UI for that we can use 
something called as expressions if  

you want to go and display the some value here.
You can use something called as an expression the  

expression is denoted by this double curly bracket 
out here you start with the double curly bracket  

and you end with a double curly bracket.
This is called as an expression because you can go  

and you can write some expression like 1+1 and it 
will evaluate to 2 this is termed as an expression  

also many people call it as an interpolation.
Interpolation means we can mix html  

with this data out here like this I can say 
bold slash bold and I can mix the angular  

directive the angular expression like this.
So remember you can term it as an expression  

or ypu can term it as an interpolation because 
you can mix html with the angular variables. 

Ng model is a directive which helps you to 
bind the input element with the component  

with the variables or the objects 
at the back of the component. 

Now you can see there is some error out here let 
us try to understand this error if you go and if  

you see this error is says that error occurred.
Now first thing how should you read the error  

very important you can see here now 
we have got lot of red sings out here  

and how do I go and read the error.
First thing is when you see an error  

you will normally be at the bottom you 
will be we will be at the bottom like this  

try to go and scroll till the top and read 
the first error which occurred because. 

That’s where the most important information 
I’m going to go now to the place in event  

of where the error occurred first where 
it showed the first red sing here it is. 

You can see here first you can see that before 
this everything was green and here we had this  

error you can see the error number out here 
saying angular 8 0 0 2 and what is the error. 

I cannot bind ng model since it isn’t known 
property of an input it is actually throwing  

up a error here saying that he cannot bind 
ng model or he does not understand ng model. 

You can see it says error occurs in the template 
remember I said template means the html 5 means  

the UI you can see this wording’s out 
here it’s occurring in the template. 

And it is also saying that at which line 
it is occurring 1,20 means line number 1  

and column number 20, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
this you know it’s saying that it is the error. 

Is occurring in the column number 20 can 
probably be this that means that he’s not  

understanding ng model that’s the whole point 
he’s not understanding the syntax of ng model. 

And why is not understanding because you have 
not loaded the appropriate angular modules  

Remember when we saw the package.json file 
in the package.json file we saw that angular. 

Has lot of angular is modular it has 
lot of modules like angular animation,  

angular common, angular core, angular router 
for navigation and angular forms for binding. 

The binding magic is in angular forms and it 
is and we need to go and load this angular  

form let us go down to the module level.
At the module level let us go and import  

the forms module let us go and import the forms 
module what will do here will do here we’ll say  

comma and we’ll say forms module.
You can see out here now when you tab  

out here automatically it imports the form module 
at the top and it puts this form module out here. 

In the ng model decorator you will 
go to the import section and you  

will input the forms module and once you 
do that he should be able to understand. 

The ng model syntax I’m going to go and save it 
and let us go down below and let us check that  

if our error has gone off you can see now the 
error has gone off it is compiled successfully. 

Remember that when you actually go 
and write any directive out here  

the appropriate module has to be loaded from 
angular so that directive can be recognized. 

With all that now let us go ahead 
and run our application let us see  

localhost 4200 that it is you 
can see the first thing is  

this expression 1 + 1 has been evaluated To 2. 

Remember our click was working the hello that 
is out there and now when I go and when I type  

on this you can see the expression 
getting changed when I type on this. 

The data is getting binded to some value at 
the back and also our expression is getting  

updated this is the expression this is the 
interpolation you can say it is getting updated. 

Binding if you want to go bind an input element 
to the component variables and objects you can  

use the ng model directive this is a 
directive this click is a directive. 

This is an expression this is an interpolation 
and remember you have to load the forms module  

or else you will not understand the 
syntax of ng model and most important. 

Whenever you get an error you will go till the 
top these are important points as a fresher to  

understand as a newcomer to understand in angular.
Remember whenever you get an error like this you  

will scroll to the last point with the to 
the first error where the error occurred  

this was the last time when angular 
compiled successfully just after that. 

And whenever you get such kind of an error 
where it says that can’t bind can’t understand  

that means that module has not been loaded.
Once you load the module once you go here and  

say load forms module everything works perfectly 
nice now let us go ahead and write some logic. 

And afterwards when we have finished 
writing this logic we can go through the  

important directives of angular or the 
different types of directives in angular. 

The logic is ad follows the logic which 
we want to write in angular is as follows  

the end user can go and type on this text 
box and when it clicks on this button here. 

It should add this value to a table down below 
the end user goes types a value he clicks on this  

button out here and once he clicks on this 
button it should go ahead and add some. 

Add the data to a table down that means 
that now this text box is binded first  

thing this text box is binded to this 
some value string that is the first thing. 

If you want to go and show it in a table 
the first thing what we have to do is  

that we have to store this some value in 
a collection we’ll go here and we’ll say. 

Some value and will create a collection some 
values some value singular saying that this is  

binded with the text box and some values it’s 
a collection saying that it will be binded. 

With the table now you can either go with 
pure JavaScript and you can say some values  

is equal to square bracket and this creates 
a collection or what you can do is you can. 

Use typescript you can say array of string you 
can go and say array a string = new array of  

string and then in this call some 
logic remember that this call. 

Some logic is present in this click 
button out here in this call some logic  

we will go and we will say ad this 
some value to some values remember. 

Some values is plural it represents 
collection we’ll say here some  

values.pushed and we’ll say some value 
and you would like to also go and clear. 

This text box as well what we’ll do is we’ll say 
some value is equal to empty this will go and will  

clear the value as well on the text box.
And now let us go ahead and create a table  

down below we’ll say here br 
we’ll create a simple table  

some value now we would 
like to go and loop this tr. 

The below tr we would like to go and loop 
it until we have data in the collection  

loop to the elements in the collection 
these are some values is a collection. 

We would like to go and loop to do a loop we can 
use the ng for syntax we’ll say here star ngFor =  

let temp off now what is our collection 
our collection is some values. 

Temp off some value what will happen 
is this ng for syntax out here will go  

and make a loop it will take every value 
and it will put into this temp variable. 

And now we’ll go here and we will say display 
the temp remember the displaying part is the same  

as we have used an expression as 
we have used an interpolation. 

That’s it this should work let us go back to 
our UI and let us see we will say here shiv  

and let us add we’ll say test and let us 
add you can see how simple it is by using. 

Angular by using the power of directives 
by using this ngFor by using this ng model  

by using this expression by using  

this beautiful code of typescript which is.
Class oriented which is strongly typed  

how easy it is to code using angular now 
let us try to understand the different  

directives in angular you can see here.
That we have written some directives we  

have written ng model we have written ngFor 
let us try to understand these directives  

what we’ll do is in order to understand.
These directives let us go to the official  

website of angular.io we’ll do like this we’ll let 
us Google I would like to use the notes directly  

from the official website rather than showing.
My notes out here we’ll say here  

different directives in angular and 
we are very we are mostly interested  

to read from angular.io here we go and you 
can see here angular.io you can see the.
