Here are terms which stranger for me.

#### A

**abstract data type (ADT)**

A mathematical model for data types in which a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. 
This contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data from the point of view of an implementer rather than a user.

What is General Availability?
General Availability (GA) is the release of a product to the general public. When a product reaches GA, it becomes available through the company’s general sales channel — as opposed to a limited release, or beta version, used primarily for testing and user feedback purposes.

### questions
- What does inline mean ?

# Terms
- sandbox, what, why ?

- self-contained

- Build
    - Does it means build source code to binary file ?
        ```
        If I'm not wrong, to "build" generally means to compile files into machine readable ones and then group them into an executable.
        ```
