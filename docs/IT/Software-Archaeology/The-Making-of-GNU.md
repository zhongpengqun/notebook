imagine a world where sharing ideas and

collaborating freely are the pillars of

technological progress a world where

freedom and Innovation go hand in hand

gnu's not Unix that is what gnu gnu

stands for the gnu project started off

as an ambitious initiative aimed at

developing a completely free and open

source operating system along with the

suite of compatible software but ended

up having a much more profound impact on

the world of software development than

anyone could have imagined this video is

the second in my series The Making of

telling the history of some of the most

important software of the past that

shaped our present not just the software

of today but the entire industry of

software development with the next

episode being about the making of BSD as

a follow-up to the many comments

received on episode 1 the making of

Linux about it being the actual world's

first open source operating system so

we're going to address that to stay

tuned for that make sure you're

subscribed to the Channel with the

notification Bell turned on so I can

continue to make this free content for

all

our tale begins in the early 1980s at

the prestigious MIT artificial

intelligence laboratory were Richard

stallman a passionate computer

programmer and MIT alumnus was working

and in the lab there was this printer a

printer that frequently jammed so

Stahlman and his colleagues had modified

the printer software to send a

notification whenever it jams so someone

could fix it but when the lab received

their new printer from Xerox the

software was proprietary so Stoneman

couldn't make similar modifications to

improve its functionality like he had

previously he reached out to Xerox to

obtain the source code but the company

refused to share it this event was a

turning point for stallman it made him

realize how proprietary software

restricted users freedom to study modify

and share the software and he saw this

trend towards proprietary software as a

significant threat to the collaborative

environment that had existed in the

Computing Community for years I've think

that's sick I think that's a bad social

organization because we're encouraging

most what's not good for us and frankly

he was frustrated by it a frustration

that motivated him and with unwavering

determination Richard stallman announces

the gnu project on September 27 1983 and

then resigns from the mitai lab in 1984

to work on it full time stallman

outlines all of the Project's objectives

and philosophy and the now famous gnu

Manifesto A rallying cry for the

importance of users freedom and the

development of free software but he

realizes he can't do it alone so in 1985

he found the free software Foundation or

FSF to support the gnu project and

promote the free software movement the

FSF becomes the Project's Beating Heart

providing legal and financial backing to

help fund the development of this free

software and other free software alike

to clarify the word free in the name

does not refer to price it refers to

Freedom you should think of free as in

free speech not as in free beer over

time a band of talented developers

joined stallman's cause creating a suite

of groundbreaking software components

primarily written in C still in 1985 the

powerful gnu emacs text editor is

released followed by The Versatile gnu

compiler collectioner GCC as you may

have heard it in 1987 and the robust gnu

debugger or GDB in 1988. each line of

code brings the dream closer and closer

to reality a free and open operating

system that empowers users across the

globe as the project gains momentum

stallman introduces the first version of

the gnu general public license or GPL in

1989. this ingenious legal framework

protects the rights of free software

users and developers ensuring that GPL

license software remains free and open

for all to modify and redistribute and

this brings us to 1991. enter a young

finished computer science student with a

penchant for tinkering Linus Torvalds

you see back in 1987 Andrew S Tannenbaum

developed Minix a unix-like operating

system intended for academic use but

given its 16-bit architecture it wasn't

well adapted to Intel's increasingly

popular 386 designed for PCs the

microprocessor Linus was using at the

time so Minix couldn't accomplish what

Linus wanted to do which led him to

create this little kernel you may have

heard of called Linux in 1991. a kernel

is the core of an operating system

responsible for managing resources

providing access to hardware and

communicating with other software but he

hadn't created other software like text

editors compilers core utility tools or

debuggers like gnu already had but the

colonel that's one thing gnu was missing

stallman saw torvold's kernel as the

missing piece of the puzzle and set out

to integrate it with the rest of the gnu

operating system initially Torvalds

released the lineage kernel under its

own license but in 1992 he released the

kernel under the gnu general public

license and even stated making Linux

gpl'd was definitely the best thing I

ever did so now that Linux was GPL

licensed the Linux and gnu developers

worked to combine the lineage kernel

with the existing gnu components to

create a fully functional and free

operating system known as gnu Linux the

gnu components included were gnubash a

Unix shell or CLI gnu core utilities

emacs GCC GDB as previously discussed as

well as the gnu C library or glibs C and

even a few more all of these components

with the Linux kernel at its core the

gnu Linux operating system commonly

referred to Simply as Linux spreads like

wildfire eventually becoming the

foundation for countless devices and

systems worldwide but we already went

over that in the making of Linux the

world's first open source operating

system this right now is kind of the

merging point of the two videos where in

that one you can see how the Linux

kernel came about merged with gnu and

learned just how prevalent gnu Linux is

today speaking of today the tireless

pursuit of a free and open Digital

landscape continues as developers work

to improve existing components create

new software and spread the message of

free software around the world

preventing what happened to closed AI

from happening to them selling out

that's what happened to open Ai and why

I call them closed AI didn't you watch

that video the untold story of open AI

anyway what began as Richard stallman's

Vision has grown into a global movement

that Champions the values of Freedom

collaboration and Community Driven

Innovation the gnu project in the gnu

Linux operating system have not only

inspired countless developers and users

but also laid the foundation for a

thriving free and open source software

ecosystem

if I could ask you a favor from those of

you who made it this far and enjoyed the

video share it with your friends the

more I know y'all like it the more

inclined I am to make more episodes in

this series also comment what software

or even Hardware or other historical

Technologies you'd like to see in this

series I appreciate you all for the

never-ending support really and uh until

next time

okay
