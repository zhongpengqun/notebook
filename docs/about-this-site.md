## How to build this blog

I use `Github pages` and this <a href='https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman#usage'>theme</a> to build this site.


At the beginning, i use jekyll to build this blog, but it not works well on different computer, often stucks.
So i switch to use mkdocs to build this blog.
