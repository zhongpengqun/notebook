Welcome Peter.
Thank you for joining us.
PETER HESSLER: Thank you.
It's my pleasure to be here.
As Pamela explained, the bookthat you were given is RiverTown which is my first book, andI'm going to talk a littlebit about actually mysecond book which iscalled Oracle Bones.
But there is a definite linkbetween the two, and I'm goingto talk about one particularstrain thatsort of connects them.
I first went to live in China in1996 with the Peace Corps.
I was a Peace Corps volunteer ina small city called Fulingwhich was on the YangtzeRiver of quite aremote part of China.
It was a town that did not haveother foreign residentsapart from me and one otherPeace Corps volunteer.
And before we arrived therehad not been any Americansthere for about halfa century.
And we were sent thereto teach Englishat a teachers college.
In China one of the majoreducational endeavors is thestudy of English.
It's become compulsory inChinese schools from sixthgrade on, and to try to meet thedemand for teachers thereis an intensive effort attraining young people.
And that was part ofwhat we were doing.
So the students that we taughtwere college students, andthey were majoring in English.
When I taught them theywere seniors.
And their intended job was tofinish studying English andthen eventually go back totheir hometowns and homevillages and become a middleschool teachers of English.
Most of these people thatI taught were from thecountryside in China.
Most of them were from very poorbackgrounds, and oftenthe generation gap between themand their parents wasremarkable.
I had students whosegrandparents, grandmothers,had had bound feet.
A number of my students hadparents who were illiterate.
But these were youngpeople who were nowbecoming college educated.
So, in a sense, theywere a transitionalgeneration in China.
They had been born around thetime Mao Zedong died in 1976.
Most of them were 1975,1976 birthdays.
So really, in a very literalsense, they had grown up withChina's changes, and that gavethem a unique perspective onthe new China that has comeabout since reformand opening in 1978.
Studying English had oftenbeen an abstractendeavor for them.
Many of them had studied forfive or six years before theyever saw a foreigner much lesshad a conversation in English.
And, at some point, they had allgiven themselves Englishnames because usually people inChina do this when they'restudying English.
And because English was stillabstract, these names weresort of hit or miss.
I had some students whohad named themselvesafter famous people.
So I had a student who had namedherself Barbara afterBarbara Bush.
I had a student whohad named himselfArmstrong after the Astronaut.
Another young woman had namedherself Keller after HelenKeller who is a heroineto many young Chinese.
Other names were moremysterious.
I had a student who calledhimself Silence Hill.
I had another student whocalled himself Yellow.
There was a very small boy namedPen, and there was avery pretty girlnamed Coconut.
And there was one boy, a verytall boy, who always woremilitary uniform, fullcamouflage dress, who hadnamed himself Daisy.
I was never able to get a clearsense on why he had comeup with the name Daisy.
The dean actually asked me aboutit at one point, but Iliked the idea of having amysterious student with thename Daisy in full camouflagein the back of my class, andso I never encouraged himto change his name.
After graduation I taught therefor two years, and aftergraduation most of the studentsbecame teachersthemselves.
And actually a lot of themare now teaching in thecountryside in Sichuan And Ikept in touch with them.
I send letters to more than100 of them twice a year.
And so I've learnedabout their livessince leaving the college.
And, of course, many of themteach young students and theygive them English names often,and often they name them aftertheir classmates.
So now you have sort of secondgeneration Coconuts, andDaisies, and Pens.
There was one student whohad named himself DJ.
Again, I had no idea wherethat came from.
But DJ called me once when Iwas in Beijing after I hadmoved back to China.
And he said, Mr  Hessler, I wantyou to know that I gavemy students English names, andI named one student Peter andone student Adam.
Now Adam was the other PeaceCorps volunteer who taughtwith me in Fuling.
And I was very touched, andI said, oh, thank you DJ.
That's very nice of you.
And he said, actually thestudent named Peter isprobably the dumbest studentin the class.
And periodically he would keepme updated on how poorly Peterwas studying when Iwas in Beijing.
I want to talk today a littlebit about one student inparticular who I've keptin touch with.
The new book Oracle Bonesfollows a number of strandsthrough modern China includingsome historical stories, butit also follows two ofmy former students.
I want to talk aboutone of them.
His English name, whenI first began toteach him, was Willie.
And Willie is the kind of kidthat I think every teacher hasno matter where he orshe is working, butparticularly in China.
First of all he was froma very poor background.
Neither of Willie's parentscould read or write.
Actually his father hadnever even attendedschool for one day.
He'd grown up on a very smallfarm, and neither of hisbrothers went beyondelementary school.
And somehow this kidhad made it out, hehad tested into college.
And he had a gift for English.
He was obsessed withthe language.
He studied it constantly.
He would listen to Voice ofAmerica, listen to the BBC.
He would read anything he couldget his hands on, andcollected words.
He was fascinated.
One time I gave a lesson onforeign words that have comeinto English, typhoon, and tea,and cooley and some ofthese other words.
And he would always verycarefully incorporate thoseinto his vocabulary.
He was also interested in usingthe local dialect, andSichuanese has a veryfertile dialect.
For example, in the 20s, if youwant to insult somebodyyou call them a toothbrush.
You'd say [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
And so he would often use thatterm in English as well.
When I was teaching he wasnever the kind of kid whowould be raising his hand oralways going out of his way toparticipate.
Usually he was backin the back of theroom studying something.
And then when I would walkbehind he'd covered it up.
And sometimes it was adictionary, sometimes it wassomething else.
I remember one time after classhe came up to me andsaid very carefully, he said,Mr  Hessler, how is yourpremature ejaculation?And this had been the type aterm that Willie was alwaysstudying in the back of theroom and practicing hispronunciation.
He had really a peasantsense of humor.
Nothing was out of boundsfor Willie.
Willie also had a girlfriendwhose name was Nancy.
And during his senior year,Willie, I remember, I startedreceiving his assignments.
And suddenly I receivedassignments with the nameWilliam Foster writtenacross the top.
And Willie had decided thatWillie was not good enough forhim, that he needed two names.
And then a little bitlater it becameWilliam Jefferson Foster.
And his reasoning was that Ihave a Chinese name that wasgiven to me, a surname and agiven name, and he saw noreason why he should not havethe same in English.
And he had named himself WilliamJefferson after BillClinton because Bill Clintonwas from a poor part ofAmerica but became a success.
Willie's girlfriend had theEnglish name Nancy, and shealso went fishingfor a last name.
And she happened asked Adam thefellow teacher, and sheended up becoming Nancy Drew.
But knowing Willie, most of mystudents were sort of destinedto return to their hometownsand teach.
That was the plan.
And the government hadintended that.
The government had subsidizetheir education under theunderstanding that they wouldreturn home to teach.
But there were always ways outof this as with so many thingsin China, if you could,sometimes you would pay a fineor you would make theright connections.
But somehow if you didn't wantto do this you could find away out, but it tooksome initiative.
But I can always pickout the students whoweren't going to stay.
And Willie was certainly one ofthe ones who I expected toleave.
And this was a ritual everyspring, Sichuan Province.
I sort of wish I had a map,but it's right inthe center of China.
It's a very heavily populated,mostly rural province, andit's right in the heartof the country.
And, of course, most of theeconomic boom is along thecoastal areas.
And there is a ritual everyspring where employers fromthese coastal areas would cometo Fuling, to Sichuan, to lookfor new talent basically becausethey could hire youngpeople from a town like this fora fraction of the cost inthese boomtowns.
And one group that often camewas private schools.
Private schools wouldcome looking fortalented young teachers.
And in Willie's senior yeara private school came fromWenzhou which is a city on theeastern coast.
 I'll talk moreabout Wenzhou in a minute.
A man named Mr  Wong came, andhe was an older man, verydistinguished looking.
He always wore a Mao suit, thesort of army green khaki suitthat the Chinese calla Sun Yat Sen suitthat we call Mao suit.
He said he was a member of theCommunist party, and he wasparticularly interestedin hiring otherCommunist party members.
But mostly he was looking fortalented people, and hepromised that the job, if theycame to teach at his privateschool, that they would be paidabout $100 a month, whichwas more than twice as muchas they would make in thevillages, and they wouldhave free housing.
So there was sort of a buzzthat went through theclassroom after thispresentation by this privateinstructor.
But it took a lot of guts toleave.
 And as a lot ofstudents talked aboutit, but very few ofthem took the chance.
Now you may have heard aboutmigration in China.
It's sort of probably one ofthe most important socialissues today.
There are 140 million migrantsin China, people from thecountryside who have moved tothe city, and usually fromrural backgrounds.
I think our image of this isoften of very poor peopledriven to the cities, but ina way it's very similar toAmerican immigration.
We also have thesame tradition.
if you give me your huddledmasses, give meyour tired, your poor.
But, in fact, immigrants whocome to an American, who cameto America, often are the mostcapable people in theircommunities.
They might be poor when theyarrive in comparison, but theyare people who were able to findways out and were able totake risks, and it's thesame thing in China.
Migrants tend to be peoplewho are willing to dothis, take this step.
And in my classes Ioften saw that.
The good students figuredout how to go.
And in Willie's case, he appliedfor this job alongwith Nancy.
But because neither of them wasa Communist party memberthey weren't sort of favored.
And they were not gettingany good feedbackfrom the college officials.
The college had to release theirdocuments for them toleave.
 And finally Willie, oneday near graduation, went tovisit the Communist partysecretary of the Englishdepartment.
And he sat down with him in hishome, visited him in hishome and said Mr  [? P ?], Iwould really like to go toWenzhou to teach English.
I hope there's somethingyou can do to help me.
And then he put an envelope onMr  P's tea table and left.
And the envelope containedabout $60, which was anenormous amount of money forsomebody like Willie.
His father made about$500 a year.
And he did the same thing withanother Communist partyofficial on campus.
And sure enough his documentswere released and he was ableto leave and go to the eastcoast and sort of seek hisfortune in this boomtown.
Now I would like to read fromthe first letter that he wroteme after he left.
This was after I had returned toBeijing and was becoming awriter 1999.
"Dear Pete, how is it goingwith you at present?I hope that you are not feelinglonely while in thecity of Beijing.
Some Chinese girls will be sureto have the hots for you.
But better be careful--"Wait I'm sorry.
This is the wrong letter.
[LAUGHTER]PETER HESSLER: Believe me,it's all the same.
OK, we got to dothis in order.
You're going to noticea theme anyway.
OK, this is the first letter.
"Dear Pete, I was perfectlyglad to hear fromyou this time.
In my view it should be a greatnews for China sincethere is an extra foreigntoothbrush from the other sideof the Pacific Ocean.
Probably you are beddinga Chinese bitchwhen my letter arrived.
Anyway please read it.
It can be used as Viagra.
My job in the schoolisn't so good.
I feel too tired.
In fact, we are [? coolies ?]in the school.
We are discriminated.
So there is an old bitch whois in charge of salary.
She's undersexed and mean.
She can never get any pleasurefrom anything except money.
"Half a year passed.
"I am feeling better.
Anyway I'm glad I can cometo [? Zhejiang ?]Province.
After all there are moreopportunities here.
I'm still workinghard in English.
For I have zealotryin this language.
I have confidence in myself thatone day I will be a VIPnot like a toothbrush anymore.
Meanwhile my teachinghere is successful.
You and Adam are somewhat myicons in the teaching.
Pete, I hope that you will visitme in [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
My yahoo students have itchingdesire to see you.
By the way, I have severalquestions for you.
One, what does KTV stand four?That's Karaoke TV in China.
Two, what's the term, the properEnglish term, for thepeople who go to other citiesto earn a living, especiallyfarmers from Sichuan.
Three, what's the fullform of DVD?Four, do you want to beChinese American?Five, how many wives doyou want to have?Six, are you still impotent?"And then signed, "Yours,Willy"Now this may strike you as anunusual student-teacherrelationship, but Williewas a character.
And, in a sense, this is Chinesecountryside humor,very informal, and often veryclose to the gutter.
One of the things that hadhappened to Willie when Willieand Nancy first arrived, theywent to an island off thecoast close to the city calledWenzhou which is a boomtown onthe east coast.
 And the momentthey got there they found Mr Wong, and he said oh, I'm story,there must have been amisunderstanding.
You thought that you hadthe $100 a month job.
Actually that job doesn'texist.
 Youmust have heard wrong.
But I have a job forhalf that salary.
And he said, oh I'm sorry.
You thought that therewas a free apartment.
That's not actually true.
You're going to have to findyour own apartment.
And so the first thing that theyrealized was basicallythat they had been tricked intogoing halfway across thecountry to a place where theyhad no support system at all.
And the school itself wasbasically a fraud.
Willie realized that the schoolhad been changinglocation every year.
They would find abandonedbuildings or half constructedbuildings, or old schools thatwere being abandoned for newfacilities, and just findingwhatever the cheapest placewas they could rent and set upa private school just for theshort term.
And most of the students werepeople who had failed out ofpublic schools.
And this was a high school, andin China the compulsoryeducation is only nine years.
So if a student does poorly he'snot guaranteed to have ahigh school education, butparents who wanted to sendtheir kids to the privateschool could do that.
But in this school the kidswould arrive and realize thatthey too had been tracked,and thateverything was low quality.
And then they would leaveas soon as possible.
And Willie was finedfor every studentthere who did not stay.
So it was an incredibly roughintroduction to the new economy.
And of course Mr  Wong and thewife, Willie wrote about thewife who only caredabout money.
She was the one who dockhis pay if he hadstudents who left.
And Mr  Wong himself was alwaystalking probably abouthis years in the Communistparty and his militaryservice, which was alwaysmysterious.
Mr  Wong's office had only onebook, the massive book thatwas entitled in ChineseA Record of theWorld's Famous People.
And this book, when Willieleafed through it, only namethat he recognizedwas Mr  Wong.
And it was seemed to be one ofthese things where you paid tosort of have yourselfinto this book.
And it was another device thatthis entrepreneur used to sortof convince people thatwhat he was doingwas actually education.
I would like to read anotherletter, the second letter thathe wrote me later that spring.
"Dear Pete, how's it goingwith you at present?I hope that you're not feelinglonely in the city of Beijing.
Some Chinese girls will be sureto have the hots for you.
But you better be carefulbecause Chinese girls alwaysblow hot and cold.
It has been raining allthese days here.
My feeling is justlike the raining.
Actually I'm a little bitbored and annoyed by thethings around mein the school.
For a long time I haveno mood for teaching.
As soon as I stand on theplatform of a classroom I hopethat the bell rings.
All the students are yahoos.
Some of them are brutaland uneducated.
Many of the students want todrop out of the school while Ifail to block the wayout for others.
Many yahoos notice thatthey have been had.
Surely more students willescape from the school.
What interests me most is thatI can learn English via VOAand a dictionary of Americancolloquialism.
I hope that in a short timeI can put them into usecorrectly and freely.
Afraid that my strong willwill be damaged, I wishmyself a way out.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]is a very small place.
In other words, I'm somewhatisolated from the wonderfuloutside world.
I'm afraid I will not be able touse English well as long asI stay here.
You see, I have zealotry aboutthe English language which isconsidered to be my betterhalf all my life.
"I'd like to talk a littlebit about hisrelationship with language.
First of all, that termyahoo that he uses, mystudents had studied.
I taught literature, and he hadpicked that up and fromGulliver's Travels.
They had no idea aboutthe company, Yahoo!But they loved the word partlybecause it sounds like aChinese word.
And actually in Szechuan theycan't distinguish between Fsand Hs, so the students wouldoften call it yafoo.
Yafoo is the way thatthey said it.
Willie, even when he moved tothis job and was immediatelydisappointed, he was convincedthat he still would haveopportunities if he improvedhis English.
So every night he would listento the Voice of America or theBBC, and would transcribe pagesand pages of English.
During the time that he was inthis town he wore out threedictionaries, broke the spinesof three dictionaries.
And when I visited his apartmenthe had them lined upproudly on his bookshelf likethe way that an outfielderwould keep his gold glove,never throw it away.
One of his favorite programswas called see AmericanMetaphors on Voice of Americawhere he could use colloquialstatements.
But the problem with that, ofcourse, is on Voice of Americathere's never any obscenities.
But Willie solved that problemone day when he found adictionary that was calledA Dictionary of AmericanEuphemisms.
 And that turnedout to be devoted almostentirely to the scatological,and sexual, and all the thingsthat Willie was interested.
One time I was visiting him,and picked up the book andjust randomly openedit to a page.
And the first word that sortof jumped out at me wasdominatrix.
But this was away from him tosupplement his vocabulary.
But he was, as he said,he was somewhatisolated from the boomtown.
That was his interest.
 He hadgone to the east to look forlife in a boomtown, and he wason the outskirts of Wenzhou.
I don't know if anybodyhas heard of Wenzhou.
It's one of the most famousnew cities in China.
They're famous because afterthe reformers began in the1980s, Wenzhou Joe was one ofthese places that respondedvery quickly.
They had had a history of doingbusiness before theCommunists came to power.
Because Wenzhou isgeographically isolated fromthe rest of China.
It's very hard for themto go to the interior.
So from ancient times onthey were traitors.
They used their coastalposition to do trade.
And they always hadcontact abroad.
There were Wenzhou peopleeverywhere.
And so after the reformersbegan, even though thegovernment never gave them aspecial preference, the peopleresponded very quickly.
And often it was sort ofbootstrap capitalism.
It wasn't for an investment.
It was local investment.
And so often they wouldstart very small andthen gradually expand.
And what that meant wasthat often theymade very simple products.
And a family would start a smallwarehouse, and then theywould expand, expand, expand,and eventually get bigger.
And eventually Wenzhou becamefamous for certain things,became famous for shoes.
Right now 600 millionpairs of shoes ayear are made in Wenzhou.
They're famous for cigarettelighters.
70% of the world cigarettelighters come from this city.
I drove through this arearecently, and all around thistown, all around the cityare other small towns.
Each of them has found aniche in the economy,in the global economy.
I drover through one place andI noticed that everywhere Ilooked there was playgroundequipment.
It was called [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
And sure enough I stopped tocheck and there were 270factories there that were makingjungle gyms basically.
And that was 50% of the Chinesemarket for that product.
I went through a place called[UNINTELLIGIBLE]where, in the center of town,they had an enormous statuethat had a button with wings.
And it turned out that[UNINTELLIGIBLE]is the button capitalof China.
They had 380 factoriesmaking buttons.
They're also famousfor zippers.
I went over to a place called[UNINTELLIGIBLE], and I askedpeople there what do you make.
And some guy pulled out apack of playing cards.
And sure enough, when I lookedinto the statistics,[UNINTELLIGIBLE] makes morethan a billion decks ofplaying cards a year.
So this whole landscapeis like this.
You have [UNINTELLIGIBLE]which makesunderwear and bras.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]makes hardware.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] isfamous for locks.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]makes faucets.
There is a place named[UNINTELLIGIBLE]which is known for makingping pong paddlesand badminton rackets.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] makes lace.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]makes 1/3 of theworld's socks.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]makes 350 million umbrellasa year.
And there's a place called[UNINTELLIGIBLE]that produces 40% of theworld's neckties.
And even in China it's sort ofa mystery how the Wenzhoupeople do it.
And when you travel in China youoften see books about theWenzhou business model.
What can we learn fromthe Wenzhou people?The last time I was in WenzhouI stopped in the airport, andthere were nearly a dozen booksabout business in Wenzhou.
One book was called The Secretsof How Wenzhou PeopleMake Money.
Another one was called TheWenzhou Code: Deciphering theCulture of a Kingdomof Business.
Another one was 36 Examples ofMoney-earning Wenzhou People.
And another book was calledThe Jews of the East: theCommercial Stories of 50Wenzhou Businessman.
I actually met an entrepreneurwho explained to me veryseriously, he said, you know inEurope, they say that theJews are the Wenzhoupeople of Europe.
That was his perspectiveon it.
I happen to be and Wenzhoufor Valentine's Day.
It's a good place to spenda romantic holiday.
And the local paper had a surveywhere they had surveyed20 Wenzhou Joe millionaires toask them about Valentine's.
These were all men, and theasked them, what do you do forValentine's Day?What do you give your wife, andthese sort of questions.
And one of the questions theyasked was if you had to choosebetween your businessand your family,which would you choose?60% chose their business, 20%chose their family and 20%couldn't make up their minds.
So that says something aboutthe Wenzhou model.
In Wenzhou the economy is 90%private, and that has actuallycome to include education.
In this city even privateschools havefound a distinct niche.
Now China education is stillstrictly controlled by theCommunist party.
You cannot start a school andbegin to teach theories thatare not kosher.
And so, in a sense, if you'restarting a private school someof your options are limited.
You can't have a radicallydifferent curriculum.
But what the private schoolsrealize is that they can teachthe same stuff basicallyat a higher volume.
In a way, I mean this is an areathat their economic modelbasically is marginproduction.
They're not involvedin innovation orhigh value-added goods.
They are making very simplethings, but they find ways tocut the margins.
And in education they did thesame thing essentially.
For example, the school wereWillie taught distinguisheditself because they beganteaching English in firstgrade instead of insixth grade likelocal public schools.
And that became their niche.
And, of course, the publicschool quickly responded, butthe private school was alwaysa little bit ahead.
For example, in Willie's school,the students who werein their examination year wouldhave class every day ofthe week including Sunday.
The eighth graders had 75class hours a week.
That's more than ten hours a dayin the classroom, whereasthe average Chinese publicschool has 45.
And like so many things inChina the competition wasincredibly intense.
In Willie's generation one ofthe lessons is of movement,another lesson is simplycompetition.
This is the first generationthat has been forced tocompete on the free market.
And this was something that,whenever I talked to Willie,this weighed on him very heavilybecause in his schoolthere had been a public schoolthat decided they were goingto drive his private schoolout of business.
And every year there was acutthroat competition betweenwho would send the moststudents, graduating students,to the good high school.
Because the goal was to haveyour eighth grade studentsqualify for the good highschool, and they competed onthese terms.
And, of course, the first stageof competition was tostudy as much as possible.
They realized if you preparediligently then you're goingto do better on the exam.
But very quickly, they realizedthat if you actuallyknow the questionsin advance you'regoing to do even better.
And it did not take the peoplein Wenzhou very long to get tothat point.
And by the time Willie was atthe school an enormous amountof energy was being invested incheating basically, tryingto find leaks in theexamination.
And so every year Willie wouldtell me they would invite amember of the Ministry ofEducation from Wenzhou, fromthe city government, tocome and give a talk.
And the idea was that he wouldleak information because hewas known for doing this.
And so he would come in Williesaid they were take him out toa fine meal and thenthey would give hima few hundred dollars.
And then they would hirea young woman to spendsome time with him.
And I asked Willie whatdoes that mean?Is she a prostitute?And he said, what doyou think it means?And every year the man wouldgive them some tips for theexams.
 And every year the tipsturned out to be false.
One time I ask him well, whydo you continue to do this?He said, you don't know.
Maybe next time itwill be accurate.
That was the perspectivein the school.
But every year it seemedto be the same ritual.
And every year I receiveda letter about this.
One year he wrote, "the samething happened again.
Many other schools got the infoabout the high schoolexaminations.
Our school got a littlesecondhand ormaybe third hand info.
So we are doomed to failure.
Again the fucking guy from theEducational Administration letout the secret of theexamination.
" So he wouldoften give the secret to theschools that paid more, andthe other ones would beleft without much.
Now I'd like to talk a bit aboutthe climate for a youngperson like this.
One of the issues of migrationis simply what is it like fora young person who goes thisfar from home in China?One thing, obviously, isthey suddenly enter anentirely new economy.
The sense of competition wastotally different from whatsomeone like Williehad grown up with.
But even the culture wastotally foreign.
One year another of my formerstudents who was calledShirley wrote me a letterafter she migratedto that same area.
And she wrote, "Peter, until nowI never get the feeling ofliving in a completelydifferent place.
It's not good to feel.
I can understand now what youand Adam said to us before.
You said you were foreigners,and that makes a difference inpeople's heart.
For the native, youare a stranger.
It's hurtful becausethey don't groupyou in their group.
You can understandwhat they say.
So the feeling of home clingsto you naturally.
Here we can't understandwhat the natives say.
They're dialects are strange tous because their tone andrhythm are so far differentfrom ours.
We can only speak standardChinese, but some natives canunderstand standard Chinese,especially the older people.
"I think sometimes we havea vision of China as amonolithic place, and peoplespeak Chinese.
But the truth is that it'sincredibly diverse, andespecially from a linguisticpoint of view.
The languages of China areabout as diverse as thelanguages spoken in the romanceparts of Europe.
And if somebody from Sichuangoes to Wenzhou, they won'tunderstand a word that thelocals are saying.
The languages arethat different.
So many of my former studentswho left home, at some point,they always wrote mea letter like this.
Now I know what it's liketo be a foreigner.
So, in a sense, it was the firsttime for them to viewtheir country as if throughan outsider's eyes.
One year Willie wrote to meabout his experiences there.
Often they would experienceprejudiceof one form or another.
For example, when Willie was inthat town he noticed thatthe teachers from Sichuantended to bepaid lower, paid less.
He noticed that factoriessometimes would have signs upthat would say, we don't wantanybody from Sichuan Provinceor [? Zhejiang ?]I was recently in one of thesefactory towns watchingrecruiting at a factory.
And as workers were coming inlooking for jobs, potentialworkers, there was a guard atthe gate who was checkingeverybody's ID, and anybody whowas from Wenzhou Provincehe turned away.
And I asked him why,and he said, well,we don't like them.
They fight too much.
And really because Wenzhouwas a fairlypoor part of the country.
It's like, in America, if youhad a guard at the gate sayingnobody from Alabama can comehere, no workers fromMississippi.
And Willie once commented to methat when he was a child,he said, when he was growingup, his parents would oftenthreatened, or adults in thevillage would often threatenchildren if there are bad bysaying, if you don't behave,the foreigners are going tocome and steal you, or theforeigners are going tocome and eat you.
And in Wenzhou, in the neweconomy, he would hear peoplesay, if you're not good themigrants are going to get you,the people from Sichuan or thepeople from [? Zhejiang ?].
So, in a sense, they hadbecome foreigners.
One year he wrote to me, "Icompletely understand whatyou're feeling when you'retreated differently in China.
Obviously the Sichuanesepeople were treateddifferently by other people.
For Sichuan is very famous forbeing poor and backward.
Here the same thing happens.
People from Sichuan and[? Zhejiang ?] were alwayslooked down on by the natives.
I don't care much about that.
I know that China is nottheir China only.
Each citizen in China has theequal right to go anywhere inChina.
"So I think this is one of themore interesting aspects ofmigration is, first of all, thenew perspective, but alsothe sense of beingan individual.
He was making a decisionthat it doesn't matterwhat group he's from.
He is the same as anybody else,and he should be treatedthe same way.
Of course, the flip side ofthis is when you look at ayoung person like this in China,what is the option ifyou were from the countryside?And this is something elsethat's quite striking.
For a young person from thecountryside, more and moreliving in the villageis not sustainable.
There are still jobs there.
There are still farmingpositions.
But compared to these boomtowns,the gap is growingwider and wider.
And by now Willie was oneof the first fromhis class to migrate.
But by now he says pretty mucheverybody that he grew up withis gone, is gone fromthe village.
And he often described to me howwhen he went back to hishometown nobody was there exceptthe older people, andnothing had changed.
And he's living in a place inthese factory towns where theinfrastructure is beingbuilt constantly.
Everything is changingday to day.
And then he would go backto the village andit would feel dead.
One year after returning homeand visiting his parents hewrote, "when I am home nothinghas changed and the roads arestill rough and peopleare getting older.
It makes me sad that I cannotfind familiar people orfriends who I knew wellwhen I was young.
Sometimes I think this kind oflife, going out to the coastalregions without a stable home,is the saddest and moststressful thing in the world.
"In some ways, whenever I readthese kind of comments, itmade me think of descriptionsof the industrial revolutionin England and in Europe whereyoung villages were basicallyemptying out as people went tothe centers of productivity.
And in China we're seeing thesame thing but at a muchfaster pace.
There are villages in a Beijingoutskirts where Ioften go hiking and camping.
And a number of times I've comeupon villages that arecompletely abandoned, justtotally empty, a group ofmaybe ten houses.
One time I stumbled onto a groupof ten houses that werejust the walls werefalling apart, theroofs were caving in.
It was like a ghost town.
But then when I went in thehouses had been wallpapered inthe traditional countrysidemanor with newspapers.
And so you can read theheadlines and read the dates.
The newspapers werefrom 1986, 1987.
And that told me that thehouses had been lived infairly recently, but itshowed how fast thischange had come about.
In the matter of less than 20years a place to go from beinga vibrant village where peoplewere improving their houses tobeing a ghost town.
So this is the climatefor young Chinese.
I think actually thisis sort of anintroduction to Willie's story.
But I don't want to go too longbefore I get to questionsbecause I want to giveyou a chance to seewhat interests you.
His story is something that Icontinue to follow in thisbook, Oracle Bones looking athow he copes with this newenvironment and with newcompetition that heexperiences there.
So now I'd just like to leavethe floor open for any sort ofquestions that you might haveabout his story or aboutanything else in China.

帕梅拉·桑格： 大家好。
我叫 Pamela Saenger 感谢大家参加今天的 Authors at Google 演讲。
我想在这里介绍彼得·何伟，他是《纽约客》驻北京的记者，在这里讨论他的新书《甲骨文：中西之旅》。
你会注意到你的《江城：长江上的两年》。
将其视为一种刺激您对他的新书胃口的预告片。
Peter 是土生土长的密苏里州哥伦比亚人，在 1996 年作为 PeaceCorps 志愿者前往中国之前，他曾在普林斯顿大学和牛津大学学习英语文学。
他在江城涪陵两年的英语教学经历启发了他的第一本书，广受好评。
在和平队结束后，何伟为《大西洋月刊》和《纽约时报》写了自由撰稿人，之后于 1999 年回到中国，成为一名常驻北京的自由撰稿人。
在那里，他为《亚洲华尔街日报》、《波士顿环球报》和《南华早报》等多家刊物撰稿，之后开始为《国家地理》和《纽约客》杂志工作。
2001年，纽约客任命他为中华人民共和国第一位全职驻地记者。
他的作品还出现在《纽约时报》、《费城问询报》、《华盛顿邮报》、《纽瓦克星报》和《国家地理》上。
彼得·赫斯勒 (Peter Hessler) 的杂志故事已入选 2001、2004 和 2005 年最佳美国旅行写作选集，以及 2004 年最佳美国体育写作选集。
他目前居住在北京。
欢迎彼得。
感谢您加入我们。
彼得海斯勒： 谢谢。
我很高兴来到这里。
正如 Pamela 解释的那样，给你的书是 RiverTown，这是我的第一本书，我要谈谈我的第二本书，叫做 Oracle Bones。
但两者之间有明确的联系，我将讨论一种将它们联系起来的特殊关系。
1996 年，我在和平队第一次去中国生活。
我是一个叫涪陵的小城市的和平队志愿者，这个城市位于中国相当偏远的长江流域。
这是一个除了我和另一名和平队志愿者之外没有其他外国居民的小镇。
在我们到达之前，那里已经有大约半个世纪没有美国人了。
我们被派往一所师范学院教英语。
在中国，一项主要的教育工作是学习英语。
从六年级开始，它成为中国学校的必修课，为了满足对教师的需求，正在大力培训年轻人。
那是我们正在做的事情的一部分。
所以我们教的学生是大学生，他们主修英语。
当我教他们的时候，他们已经是大四学生了。
而他们打算的工作是学完英语，然后最终回到家乡和家乡，成为一名中学英语教师。
我教过的这些人大部分来自中国农村。
他们中的大多数出身贫寒，而且往往与父母之间的代沟非常大。
我有一些学生，他们的祖父母、祖母都裹过小脚。
我的许多学生的父母都是文盲。
但这些都是正在接受大学教育的年轻人。
所以，从某种意义上说，他们是中国的过渡一代。
他们出生在毛泽东 1976 年逝世前后。
他们中的大多数是1975、1976的生日。
所以，从字面意义上讲，他们是随着中国的变化而成长的，这让他们对自 1978 年改革开放以来出现的新中国有了独特的视角。
学习英语对他们来说常常是一种抽象的努力。
他们中的许多人学习了五六年，才见过外国人，更不用说用英语交谈了。
而且，在某些时候，他们都给自己起了英文名字，因为中国人在学习英语时通常会这样做。
而且因为英语仍然很抽象，所以这些名字有点随意。
我有一些学生以名人的名字命名自己。
所以我有一个学生以芭芭拉布什的名字给自己取名芭芭拉。
我有一个学生，他以宇航员的名字给自己取名阿姆斯特朗。
另一位年轻女子以海伦凯勒的名字给自己取名凯勒，海伦凯勒是许多中国年轻人心目中的女英雄。
其他名字更神秘。
我有一个学生，他自称寂静岭。
我有另一个学生，他自称是黄色的。
有一个非常小的男孩叫 Pen，还有一个非常漂亮的女孩叫 Coconut。
还有一个男孩，一个很高的男孩，他总是穿着军装，全迷彩服，他给自己起名叫黛西。
我一直无法清楚地知道他为什么想出黛西这个名字。
院长实际上有一次问过我，但我喜欢让一个名叫黛西的神秘学生出现在我班级后面的想法，所以我从不鼓励他改名。
毕业后我教了两年，毕业后大部分的学生教师自己成为了教师。
事实上，他们中的很多人现在都在四川的农村教书，我和他们保持着联系。
我每年两次给其中的 100 多人寄信。
所以我了解了他们离开大学后的生活。
当然，他们中的许多人教年轻学生，他们经常给他们起英文名字，而且他们经常以同学的名字命名。
所以现在你有了第二代椰子、雏菊和钢笔。
有一个学生给自己起名叫 DJ。
再一次，我不知道那是从哪里来的。
但是我回国后在北京的时候DJ给我打过一次电话。
他说，赫斯勒先生，我想让你知道我给学生起了英文名字，我给一个学生起名叫彼得，一个学生叫亚当。
现在亚当是另一位在涪陵和我一起教书的和平队志愿者。
我很感动，我说，哦，谢谢 DJ。
你真好
他说，实际上那个叫彼得的学生可能是班上最笨的学生。
他会定期向我通报我在北京时彼得的学习情况。
我今天想谈一谈我一直保持联系的一位学生。
新书甲骨文沿袭了现代中国的许多线索，包括一些历史故事，但它也沿袭了我以前的两个学生。
我想谈谈其中一个。
当我刚开始教他时，他的英文名字是 Willie。
威利是那种我认为每个老师都拥有的孩子，无论他或她在哪里工作，尤其是在中国。
首先，他出身贫寒。
威利的父母都不识字。
事实上，他父亲一天都没上过学。
他在一个非常小的农场长大，他的两个兄弟都没有读过小学。
不知何故，这个孩子成功了，他考上了大学。
他有英语天赋。
他痴迷于这门语言。
他不断地研究它。
他会听美国之音，听 BBC。
他会阅读任何他能拿到手的东西，并收集文字。
他着迷了。
有一次我上了一节课，讲的是已经进入英语的外来词，typhoon，tea，cooley 和其他一些词。
他总是非常小心地将这些纳入他的词汇表。
他也对使用当地方言很感兴趣，而四川话的方言非常丰富。
例如，在 20 年代，如果你想侮辱某人，你会称他们为牙刷。
你会说[无法理解]。
所以他也经常在英语中使用那个词。
当我教书的时候，他从来都不是那种会特意举手参与的孩子。
通常他会回到房间的后面研究一些东西。
然后当我走在他身后时，他把它掩盖了。
有时它是上瘾的，有时它是别的东西。
我记得有一次下课后他走到我面前，非常小心地说，他说，赫斯勒先生，你早泄怎么样？这是威利一直在房间后面学习并练习发音的类型词。
他真的很有农民的幽默感。
威利没有什么不能做的。
威利还有一个女朋友，她的名字叫南希。
在他大四那年，威利，我记得，我开始接受他的作业。
突然间，我收到了作业，上面写着威廉·福斯特的名字。
威利认为威利配不上他，他需要两个名字。
过了一会儿，它变成了威廉·杰斐逊·福斯特。
他的理由是我有一个给我的中文名字，一个姓氏和一个名字，他看不出为什么他不应该有相同的英文名。
他以比尔克林顿的名字给自己取名威廉杰斐逊，因为比尔克林顿来自美国的贫困地区，但却取得了成功。
威利的女朋友有一个英文名字南希，她也去钓鱼了一个姓氏。
她碰巧问了同班老师亚当，结果她变成了南希·德鲁。
但是认识威利后，我的大多数学生都注定要回到家乡教书。
这就是计划。
政府有意这样做。
政府补贴他们的教育，前提是他们会回国教书。
但是总有办法解决这个问题，因为在中国有很多事情，如果可以的话，有时你会支付罚款或者你会建立正确的联系。
但不知何故，如果你不想这样做，你可以找到离开，但这需要一些主动性。
但我总能挑出那些不会留下来的学生。
威利当然是我希望离开的人之一。
这是四川省每年春天的一个仪式。
我有点希望我有一张地图，但它就在中国的中心。
这是一个人口非常稠密的省份，大部分是农村省份，而且它就在这个国家的中心。
当然，大部分经济繁荣都发生在沿海地区。
每年春天都有一个仪式，来自这些沿海地区的雇主他们会来四川涪陵寻找新人才，主要是因为他们可以用这些新兴城市的一小部分成本从这样的小镇雇用年轻人。
经常来的一个群体是私立学校。
私立学校会来寻找有才华的年轻教师。
在威利的高年级，一所私立学校来自东部沿海城市温州。
 我待会儿再详细谈谈温州。
来了一个叫王先生的人，他是个年长的人，看上去非常尊贵。
他总是穿着中山装，那种军绿色的卡其色西装，中国人称之为孙中山装，我们称之为中山装。
他说他是共产党员，他特别有兴趣雇用其他共产党员。
但他主要是在寻找有才能的人，他承诺这份工作，如果他们来他的私立学校教书，他们将获得大约每月 100 美元的报酬，这是他们在村子里的收入的两倍多，而且他们将获得免费住房。
因此，在这位私人教师的演讲结束后，教室里响起了一阵嗡嗡声。
但是离开需要很大的勇气。
 很多学生都在谈论它，但很少有人抓住机会。
现在你可能听说过中国的移民。
这可能是当今最重要的社会问题之一。
中国有 1.4 亿农民工，他们从农村搬到城市，而且通常出身于农村。
我认为我们对此的印象通常是非常贫穷的人被驱赶到城市，但在某种程度上它与美国移民非常相似。
我们也有同样的传统。
如果你给我你拥挤的群众，给我你的疲倦，你的穷人。
但是，事实上，来到美国的移民往往是他们社区中最有能力的人。
他们来的时候可能比较穷，但是他们是有出路的人，有冒险精神的人，在中国也是一样。
移民往往是愿意这样做、迈出这一步的人。
在我的课堂上，我经常看到这一点。
好学生想好了怎么走。
就威利而言，他和南希一起申请了这份工作。
但因为他们都不是共产党员，所以不太受宠。
而且他们没有从大学官员那里得到任何好的反馈。
学院不得不发布他们的文件让他们离开。
 最后，在临近毕业的一天，威利去拜访了英语系的共产党书记。
他在他家里和他一起坐下来，在他家里拜访了他，并说[？ P ?]，我很想去温州教英语。
我希望你能帮我做点什么。
然后他把一个信封放在P先生的茶几上就走了。
信封里装着大约 60 美元，这对像威利这样的人来说是一笔巨款。
他父亲一年挣大约 500 美元。
他对校园里的另一名共产党官员也做了同样的事情。
果然他的文件被释放了，他得以离开并前往东海岸，在这个新兴城市寻找他的财富。
现在我想读一读他离开后写给我的第一封信。
这是在我回到北京并成为一名作家之后的 1999 年。
“亲爱的Pete，你现在怎么样了？希望你在北京这座城市不会感到孤独。
一些中国女孩一定会为你着迷。
但最好小心——“等等，我很抱歉。
这是错误的字母。
[笑声] PETER HESSLER：相信我，都是一样的。
好的，我们必须按顺序执行此操作。
无论如何你都会注意到一个主题。
好的，这是第一封信。
“亲爱的皮特，这次我很高兴收到你的来信。
在我看来，这对中国来说应该是一个好消息，因为太平洋彼岸多了一把外国牙刷。
当我的信到达时，你可能正在和一个中国婊子上床。
无论如何请阅读它。
它可以用作伟哥。
我在学校的工作不太好。
我觉得太累了。
事实上，我们是 [?苦力？]在学校。
我们受到歧视。
所以有一个老婊子负责工资。
她性欲低下而且刻薄。
除了金钱，她永远无法从任何事物中得到任何乐趣。
“半年过去了。
“我感觉好多了。
不管怎样，我很高兴我能来 [?浙江?]省。
毕竟这里有更多的机会。
我仍在努力学习英语。
因为我热衷于这种语言。
我对自己有信心，总有一天我会成为贵宾，不再像牙刷那样。
与此同时，我在这里的教学是成功的。
你和亚当在教学中有点像偶像。
皮特，我希望你能在 [无法辨认] 拜访我。
我的雅虎学生渴望见到你。
顺便说一句，我有几个问题要问你。
一、什么是KTV站四？那是中国的卡拉OK电视。
二，什么是术语，正确的英文术语，对于去其他城市谋生的人，特别是来自四川的农民。
三、DVD的完整形式是什么？四、你想成为美籍华人吗？五、有多少你想娶老婆吗？六个，你还阳痿吗？”然后签了字，“你的，威利”现在这可能会让你觉得这是一种不寻常的师生关系，但威利是一个角色。
而且，从某种意义上说，这是中国乡村幽默，非常随意，而且往往非常接近阴沟。
威利和南希刚到的时候，威利遇到的一件事是，他们去了离温州很近的一个沿海小岛，温州是东海岸的一个新兴城市。
  他们一到那里就找到了黄先生，他说哦，我说的是，一定是误会了。
你以为你有一份每月 100 美元的工作。
实际上那份工作并不存在。
  你一定是听错了。
但我有一份工作，薪水只有一半。
他说，哦，对不起。
你以为有免费的公寓。
这实际上不是真的。
你将不得不找到自己的公寓。
因此，他们意识到的第一件事基本上是他们被骗到穿越半个国家去到一个他们根本没有支持系统的地方。
学校本身基本上就是一个骗局。
威利意识到学校每年都在更换地点。
他们会找到废弃的建筑物或半建成的建筑物，或因新设施而被废弃的旧学校，只要找到最便宜的地方，他们就可以租用并建立一所短期私立学校。
大多数学生都是从公立学校失败的人。
这是一所高中，在中国义务教育只有九年。
因此，如果一个学生成绩不好，他不能保证接受高中教育，但想要将孩子送到私立学校的父母可以这样做。
但是在这所学校里，孩子们会到达并意识到他们也被跟踪了，而且一切都是低质量的。
然后他们会尽快离开。
每一个没有留下来的学生，威利都会被罚款。
所以这是对新经济的一个非常粗略的介绍。
当然还有黄先生和妻子，威利写了只关心钱的妻子。
如果他有学生离开，她就是扣他工资的人。
而王先生自己也一直在谈论他在共产党的岁月和他的服役经历，这总是很神秘。
黄先生的办公室只有一本书，是一本厚厚的书，中文名是《世界名人录》。
而这本书，当威利翻阅时，他唯一认出的名字就是王先生。
这似乎是你花钱让自己进入这本书的其中一件事。
这是这位企业家用来让人们相信他所做的实际上是教育的另一种手段。
我想读另一封信，那年春天晚些时候他写给我的第二封信。
“亲爱的Pete，你最近怎么样？希望你在北京这座城市不会感到孤独。”
一些中国女孩一定会为你着迷。
但你最好小心，因为中国女孩总是忽冷忽热。
这些天这里一直在下雨。
我的心情就像下雨一样。
事实上，我对学校里我周围的事情有点厌烦和恼火。
很长一段时间我都没有心情教书。
一站在教室的讲台上，我就希望铃声响起。
所有的学生都是雅虎。
他们中的一些人很残忍，没有受过教育。
许多学生想要退学，而我却无法为其他人挡住出路。
许多雅虎注意到他们已经被拥有了。
肯定会有更多的学生逃离学校。
最让我感兴趣的是我可以通过美国之音和美国口语词典来学习英语。
我希望在短时间内能够正确、自如地使用它们。
怕自己坚强的意志受损，我希望自己有一条生路。
[无法辨认]是一个非常小的地方。
换句话说，我有点与外面美好的世界隔绝了。
只要我留在这里，我恐怕就不能很好地使用英语。
你看，我热衷于英语，这被认为是我一生中最好的一半。
“我想谈谈他与语言的关系。
首先，他用的那个termyahoo，我的学生已经学过了。
我教文学，他从格列佛游记中学来的。
他们对 Yahoo! 这家公司一无所知，但他们喜欢这个词的部分原因是它听起来像一个中文单词。
而实际上在四川他们无法区分Fs和Hs，所以学生们经常称它为yafoo。
Yafoo 就是他们所说的方式。
威利，即使当他转到这份工作并立即感到失望时，他坚信如果他提高英语水平，他仍然会有机会。
所以每天晚上他都会听美国之音或英国广播公司，并抄写一页又一页的英文。
他在这个镇上的时候，用坏了三本词典，折断了三本词典的书脊。
当我参观他的公寓时，他让他们骄傲地在他的书架上排成一排，就像这样一个外野手会保留他的金手套，永远不会扔掉它。
他最喜欢的节目之一是美国之音的“美国隐喻”，他可以在其中使用口语。
但问题是，当然，美国之音从来没有任何下流内容。
但是有一天，威利找到了一本名为《美国委婉语词典》的词典，从而解决了这个问题。
  结果几乎完全是关于粪便和性以及威利感兴趣的所有事情。
有一次我去拜访他，拿起这本书，随便翻到一页。
我突然想到的第一个词是母夜叉。
但这与他无关，以补充他的词汇量。
但正如他所说，他与新兴城市有些隔绝。
那是他的兴趣所在。
  他去东部的新兴城市寻找生活，现在他在温州郊区。
不知道有没有人听说过温州。
它是中国最著名的新城市之一。
他们之所以出名，是因为80年代改革开放后，温州乔就是其中一个反应非常快的地方。
在共产党上台之前，他们就有过做生意的历史。
因为温州在地理上与中国其他地区隔绝。
他们很难去内陆。
所以自古就是汉奸。
他们利用沿海位置进行贸易。
他们总是在国外有联系。
到处都是温州人。
所以改革派开始后，虽然政府从来没有给予他们特别的优待，但老百姓的反应还是很快的。
通常这是一种自举的资本主义。
这不是为了投资。
这是当地的投资。
因此，他们通常会从很小的规模开始，然后逐渐扩大。
这意味着他们经常制造非常简单的产品。
一个家庭会开一个小仓库，然后他们会扩大、扩大、扩大，最终变得更大。
最终温州因某些事情而出名，因鞋子而出名。
现在温州每年生产 6 亿双鞋。
他们以打火机而闻名。
世界上70%的打火机都来自这座城市。
我最近开车经过这个地区，在这个小镇周围，整个城市周围都是其他小镇。
他们每个人都在经济中，在全球经济中找到了立足点。
我开车经过一个地方，发现到处都是游乐场设备。
它被称为[无法辨认]。
果然，我停下来查看，那里有 270 家工厂基本上都在制造丛林健身房。
那是该产品在中国市场的 50%。
我经过一个叫做[无法辨认]的地方，在镇中心，他们有一个巨大的雕像，上面有一个带翅膀的按钮。
事实证明，[无法辨认]是中国的纽扣之都。
他们有 380 家制造纽扣的工厂。
他们也以拉链而闻名。
我去了一个叫[无法辨认]的地方，我问那里的人你们是做什么的。
有个人拿出一包扑克牌。
果然，当我查看统计数据时，[无法辨认]每年制作超过 10 亿副扑克牌。
所以这整个景观是这样的。
你有制造内衣和文胸的[无法辨认]。
[无法辨认]制造硬件。
[无法辨认] 因锁而闻名。
[无法辨认]制造水龙头。
有一个地方叫[无法辨认]，以制作乒乓球拍和羽毛球拍而闻名。
[无法辨认] 制作花边。
[无法辨认] 生产世界上 1/3 的袜子。
[无法辨认]每年生产 3.5 亿把雨伞。
有一个地方叫[无法辨认]，生产世界上 40% 的领带。
即使在中国，温州人是怎么做到的也有点神秘。
当你在中国旅行时，你经常会看到有关温州商业模式的书籍。
我们能从温州人身上学到什么？上次去温州，我在机场停了下来，有近十几本关于温州经商的书。
有一本书叫《温州人赚钱的秘诀》。
另一本书叫做《温州密码：解读商业王国的文化》。
另一本是温州人挣钱的36个例子。
另一本书叫《东方的犹太人：50位温州商人的商业故事》。
我其实遇到过一个企业家，他很认真的给我解释，他说，你知道在欧洲，他们说犹太人是欧洲的温州人。
这是他的看法。
我正好和温州过情人节。
这是度过浪漫假期的好地方。
当地报纸做了一个调查，他们调查了 20 位温州乔百万富翁，询问他们关于情人节的事情。
这些都是男人，他们问他们，情人节你做什么？你给你妻子什么，以及诸如此类的问题。
他们问的其中一个问题是，如果你必须在你的事业和你的家庭之间做出选择，你会选择哪个？60% 选择了他们的事业，20% 选择了他们的家庭，还有 20% 无法弥补他们的想法。
所以这说明了温州模式。
在温州，90%的经济都是民营的，这实际上已经包括了教育。
在这个城市，甚至私立学校也找到了独特的利基市场。
现在中国的教育仍然被共产党严格控制着。
你不能开办一所学校并开始教授不符合犹太教义的理论。
因此，从某种意义上说，如果你要开办一所私立学校，你的一些选择是有限的。
你不能有完全不同的课程。
但私立学校意识到，他们基本上可以以更高的音量教授相同的内容。
在某种程度上，我的意思是这是一个他们的经济模型基本上是边际生产的领域。
他们不参与创新或高附加值商品。
他们做的东西非常简单，但他们找到了削减利润的方法。
在教育方面，他们本质上做了同样的事情。
例如，威利教的学校之所以出类拔萃，是因为他们从一年级开始教英语，而不是像当地公立学校那样从六年级开始教英语。
这成了他们的利基。
当然，公立学校反应很快，但私立学校总是领先一点。
例如，在威利的学校，考试年级的学生一周中的每一天都要上课，包括星期天。
八年级学生每周有 75 课时。
这相当于每天在课堂上的时间超过 10 个小时，而中国公立学校平均有 45 个小时。
就像中国的许多事情一样，竞争异常激烈。
在威利这一代，其中一个教训是运动，另一个教训就是竞争。
这是被迫在自由市场上竞争的第一代人。
每当我和威利谈话时，这件事都会让他感到非常沉重，因为在他的学校里有一所公立学校决定要让他的私立学校倒闭。
每年都有一场激烈的比赛，谁能把最多的学生、毕业生送到好高中。
因为目标是让你的八年级学生有资格进入好高中，他们在这些条件下竞争。
当然，第一阶段的比赛是尽可能多地学习。
他们意识到，如果你认真准备，那么你会在考试中取得更好的成绩。
但很快，他们意识到，如果你真的提前知道这些问题，你会做得更好。
温州人并没有花很长时间就达到了这一点。
到威利在学校的时候，大量的精力基本上投入到作弊上，试图在考试中寻找漏洞。
所以每年威利都会告诉我，他们会邀请温州市政府教育部的一位成员来做演讲。
他的想法是他会泄露信息，因为他以这样做而闻名。
所以他会进来，威利说他们要带他出去吃一顿美餐，然后他们会给他几百美元。
然后他们会雇一个年轻女人陪他一段时间。
我问威利那是什么意思？她是妓女吗？他说，你认为这意味着什么？每年那个男人都会给他们一些考试技巧。
  每年的提示都被证明是错误的。
有一次我问他好好的，你为什么还要继续这样？他说，你不知道。
也许下次它会准确。
这就是学校的观点。
但每年似乎都是同样的仪式。
每年我都会收到一封关于此事的信。
有一年他写道，“同样的事情又发生了。
许多其他学校获得了有关高中考试的信息。
我们学校有一些二手或三手信息。
所以我们注定要失败。
教务局的那个该死的家伙又泄露了考试的秘密。
” 所以他经常把秘密告诉给钱多的学校，而其他学校则没有多少。
现在我想谈谈像这样的年轻人的气候。
移民的一个问题就是，对于一个离家这么远的中国年轻人来说，感觉如何？显然，有一件事是他们突然进入了一个全新的经济体。
竞争意识与像威利这样的人长大的感觉完全不同。
但即使是文化也是完全陌生的。
一年前，我以前的另一个学生叫雪莉，她移居到同一地区后给我写了一封信。
她写道，“彼得，直到现在，我从未有过生活在一个完全不同的地方的感觉。
感觉不太好。
我现在能理解你和亚当之前对我们说的话了。
你说你是外国人，这让人们的心发生了变化。
对于本地人来说，你是一个陌生人。
这很伤人，因为他们不把你归入他们的小组。
你可以理解他们说的话。
所以家的感觉自然而然地依附在你身上。
在这里我们听不懂当地人在说什么。
他们的方言对我们来说很陌生，因为他们的语调和节奏与我们的相差甚远。
我们只能sp中文很标准，但有些当地人能听懂标准的中文，尤其是老年人。
“我认为有时我们认为中国是一个铁板一块的地方，人们说中文。
但事实是它的多样性令人难以置信，尤其是从语言学的角度来看。
中国的语言与欧洲浪漫地区使用的语言一样多样化。
如果四川人去温州，他们根本听不懂当地人说的话。
语言是那么不同。
我以前的许多学生离家出走，在某个时候，他们总是给我写这样一封信。
现在我知道当外国人是什么感觉了。
因此，从某种意义上说，这是他们第一次以局外人的眼光看待自己的国家。
有一年威利写信给我讲述他在那里的经历。
他们常常会经历一种或另一种形式的偏见。
例如，当威利在那个镇上时，他注意到来自四川的老师的薪水往往较低，薪水较低。
他注意到工厂有时会张贴告示，上面写着，我们不想要来自四川省的任何人 [？ 浙江？]我最近在这些工厂城镇之一观看一家工厂的招聘情况。
当工人们来找工作，潜在的工人时，门口有一个警卫正在检查每个人的身份证，任何来自温州省的人他都会拒绝。
我问他为什么，他说，好吧，我们不喜欢他们。
他们打架太多了。
真的是因为温州是全国相当贫困的地区。
这就像在美国，如果你在门口有一个警卫说阿拉巴马州的人不能来这里，密西西比州的工人也不能来。
威利曾经跟我说，他小时候，他说，他长大后，他的父母经常会威胁，或者村里的大人经常会威胁孩子说，如果你不乖，外国人就会来 偷你，否则外国人会来吃你。
而在温州，在新经济中，他会听到人们说，如果你不好，移民就会得到你，四川人或[？ 浙江?]。
所以，从某种意义上说，他们成了外国人。
有一年他写信给我，“我完全理解你在中国受到不同对待时的感受。
显然，四川人受到了其他人的不同对待。
因为四川是出了名的贫穷落后。
同样的事情也发生在这里。
四川人和[? 浙江？]一直被当地人看不起。
我不太在乎那个。
我知道中国不仅仅是他们的中国。
每个中国公民都有平等的权利去中国的任何地方。
“所以我认为这是移民最有趣的方面之一，首先是新的视角，也是作为一个个体的感觉。
他正在做一个决定，不管他来自哪个团体。
他和其他人一样，他应该受到同样的对待。
当然，另一方面就是当你在中国看到这样的年轻人时，如果你来自农村，你会有什么选择？这是另外一件非常引人注目的事情。
对于一个来自农村的年轻人来说，越来越多地住在村子里是不可持续的。
那里仍然有工作。
仍然有农业职位。
但与这些新兴城市相比，差距越来越大。
到现在为止，威利是他班上第一个迁移的人之一。
但现在他说几乎所有和他一起长大的人都走了，都离开了村子。
他经常跟我说他回老家的时候除了老人家什么都没有，什么都没有变。
他住在这些基础设施不断建设的工厂城镇的一个地方。
一切都在日新月异。
然后他会回到村里，那里会感觉死气沉沉。
回国探望父母一年后，他写道，“当我在家时，一切都没有改变，道路仍然崎岖不平，人们正在变老。
找不到小时候熟悉的人或朋友，这让我很难过。
有时候我觉得，这样的生活，到沿海地区，没有一个安定的家，是世界上最悲哀和压力最大的事情。
“在某些方面，每当我读到这些评论时，都会让我想起对英国和欧洲工业革命的描述，随着人们向生产力中心转移，年轻的村庄基本上都被清空了。
在中国，我们看到了同样的事情，但速度要快得多。
北京郊区有一些村庄，我经常去那里徒步旅行和露营。
有好几次，我遇到了完全被遗弃的村庄，完全是空荡荡的，大约有十间房子。
有一次我偶然发现了一组十间房屋，它们只是墙壁倒塌，屋顶塌陷。
这就像一座鬼城。
但是当我进去的时候，房子已经贴上了传统乡村庄园的墙纸，上面贴着报纸。
所以你可以阅读标题并阅读日期。
这些报纸是1986年、1987年的。
这告诉我这些房子最近才有人住过，但它表明这种变化来得有多快。
在不到 20 年的时间里，这个地方从一个人们改善房屋的充满活力的村庄变成了一个鬼城。
这就是中国年轻人的气候。
我认为实际上这是对威利故事的介绍。
但在开始提问之前我不想拖太久，因为我想给你机会看看你感兴趣的是什么。
他的故事是我在本书中继续关注的内容，Oracle Bones 着眼于他如何应对这个新环境以及他在那里经历的新竞争。
所以现在我想请大家就他的故事或中国其他任何事情提出任何问题。
