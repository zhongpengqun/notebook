THE HERDSMAN

Based on The Soul and the Flesh by Zhang
Xianliang.

The grass bends when the wind sweeps
and one sees the cattle and sheep.

The Cilechuan Plain is below the Yinshan Mountain.

The sky is like a dome which covers over the plain.

The sky is dark green and the plain is boundless.

The grass bends when the wind sweeps and one sees the cattle and sheep.

Cilechuan Plain, an ancient name you are.I
read about you when I was twelve years old.

It didn't occur to me that I would
spend half of my life with you.

I have been staying here for 20 years.

Years. Life.

Our board chairman has a son named Xu Lingiun,
who he hasn't seen for over 30 years.

It is said that he is working in some
rangeland called Ci.

Cilechuan.

Oh. Cilechuan Rangeland.

Please help him find his son.

Ok.

Xu Lingjun.

Attention please, from Lanzhou to Beijing

Flight No.2615, Plane 212
has arrived at the airport

You must be Mr. Xu Lingiun.

Please.

OK

Put it here. Thanks.

Chairman, he is here.

Is that Lingiun

You must be tired.How long did it take the
plane to arrive here

Two hours.

How about some brandy

Ask them to send two coffees here.
Hot ones.

Ok.

What You have white hairs.

Lingiun, stand up. Walk a few steps.

Anything wrong

Walk a few steps so I can see.

Why Every time I dreamed, I
saw you had become a gimp.

Then you must have thought about that.

If we met on the street, I
wouldn't be able to recognize you.

Papa, the last time we saw each
other is when I was only 11.

It has been 30 years by now.

At the airport, I knew he was your son the
moment I saw him.

You two have almost the same forehead.

Do we? He didn't shed a
single drop of tear.

And he was very calm.

Calm

And his hands are so thick.He doesn't look
like my son.

He is the eldest grandson of my family.

His grandfather said that when he was born,
there were two pied magpies.

That he would live an
extravagant life all his life.

It has been 30 years.To me, the
word Papa is indeed strange.

I am the eldest grandson
of this rich family.

And also the bad consequence of this feudal
marriage.

Father and mother didn't get along well.
At the end, he left my mother and me.

Just before the Liberation when mother was
seriously ill, I went to see father.

That was the last time I saw him.

Before long, he went to the United States.

And mother died, four days after
he left, in a French hospital.

Let the past be the past.

As soon as I had arrived in the mainland, I learned
a political slogan: looking into the future.

We should also look into the future.

You'd better get prepared right away and
follow me to the United States.

On the one hand, I came back this time to
visit the motherland.

On the other hand, the more important thing is
that I want to take you to the United States.

Board Chairman, dinner is ready.

Ok.

Today, we have your favorite food.

Yeah. It smells good.

Help yourself to whatever you like.

Ok.

Oh. Thanks. I can do it myself.

Have some of this. It's egg white.

I see.

I always think that dishes in the
mainland are with too much sauce.

Then try this fish. Steamed fish.

The eggs cooked in tea and sauce by Xiuzhi, I
dare not present them to her father-in-law.

Poor Xiuzhi, how could you imagine that a
dinner for three would cost over 80 Yuan

Mr. Xu

Mr. Xu

Mr. Xu

Good morning, Mr. Xu.

Mr. Xu

Mr. Xu, are you going to Beijing

Yes.

When will you come back

Come back earlier.

Ok. Go to school now.

Good bye, Mr. Xu

Good bye.

Come back earlier.

Get some sleep.

I am not tired.

This short gown is too old.

If you leave one day later, I will have
finished making that new one.

I don't like wearing new clothes.

But you are going to Beijing.

Papa, where is Beijing

Beijing is to the Northeast of our town.

Papa, is Beijing as large as
many of our towns put together

Yes.Beijing is as large as many
of our towns put together.

Are there any violets in Beijing

No.

Are there any sand islands in Beijing

Neither.

Your papa is going far away this time.

He is going abroad with your grandfather.

Papa won't go abroad.

Why not

He can eat dumplings all day long abroad.

Mama said, Papa is the kite in mama's hand.

However high he ﬂies, the line is in Mama's
hand.

Don't put words in my mouth.

I didn't make it up. I heard it.
You said that last night.

Papa, I want a frozen sucker.

Ok.

Tasty

Tasty.

What have you bought

Chinese Wolf berry.They say
it is good for the old.

Take it to father-in-law.

Mama, frozen sucker. You eat.

Take this. Leave ten Yuan more at home.

No, we don't need much money at home.

People at home can do without money.But
people on journey can't.Take it with you.

Write as soon as you arrive at Beijing.

Good bye, Papa-

Oh.

Good bye.

Good bye.

Papa, good bye.

Papa, good bye.

Good bye.

Papa. Papa. Papa.

Don't run.Don't run.

Papa. Papa. Papa.

Have a seat.

May I help you

Juice, please.

Ok.

Disco Board chairman, look, they
are dancing disco in Beijing too.

Aristotle Yes.Aristotle once said, Human
beings are animals loving fun.

Nobody can resist the
temptation of enjoyment.

They won't admit that they are people
practicing asceticism any more.

Mr. Xu, can you dance

Me No, I can't.

Let me teach you.lt's easy.

Ah. No. No.I

Miss Song Miss Song, don't embarrass him
anymore.

Well, look, Manager Wang is coming for you.

Go.

Beautiful.

The Blue Danube.

Board chairman, it's waltz.Come and dance.

Lingiun, you go.

Father, you dance.

Let's go.

This son of mine, it's difficult to
communicate with him emotionally.

It seems that he is older than you.

I hope that he will become a new person.
People can change.

This time, we must change him.

Why doesn't he smile

I should thank God that he isn't crazy.

When in the United States, I will
educate him from the every beginning.

People's Daily

Oh, father.

Thank you.

My pleasure.

I find that the intellectuals in the Mainland
concern very much the so-called affairs of state.

This is because in China, the state
and one's family are closely related.

The fate of the state decides
the fate of the family.

San Francisco In the United States, San
Francisco Chemical Company is my kingdom.

Abroad, one talks about personal honor and
competition.

Father, you have your own sense of honor.

Maybe because I have been used to collective life, I attach
more importance to the sense of honor of the country.

Do you herdsmen read books written by Marx

In China, there is a mass
production of this kind of books.

So we can get them.

Nowadays, the West is also studying
Marxism, not less than the Chinese do.

Yes.But they are studying Marxism in his
books.

And the Chinese Father,
let's not talk about this.

What more is there to be considered

You are clearer than me that the policies of
the Communist Party change from time to time.

It's relatively easy to get a visa.

It's hard to say what it
will be like in the future.

There is nothing more
for you to linger for.

You have suffered a lot
in the past 20 years.

Do you still still hate me

No, I don't.

Absolutely not.

As you have said it, the past is the past.

Indeed. Let the past be the past.

But it is still painful
for me to think about it.

Lingiun, I really miss you very much.

I need you.Especially now.

Yes.This I believe.

I thought about you too.

Xu Lingjun, reactionary...

Rightist Xu Lingiun, born in a reactionary
bureaucratic capitalist family.

His father Xu Jinyou escaped to the United
States before the Liberation.

Lingiun, you are still young.

Those of us who are going to the countryside
should try our best to rebuild ourselves.

I think it will be 2 years, three years at
most.

We can still serve the people.

Mr. Xie, I am not the same as you.

All of you still have the
prospect to go back to your work.

But I don't have.

I was born in the wrong family.

I have committed the crime of being born.

Just when I was desperate and ready to
end my life, suddenly I thought of this:

I, the abandoned son of a capitalist, was
once bathed in the sunshine of the New China.

Lingiun, your stipend has been granted.

Really

You can live in the school since there is
nobody at your home.

As for your meals, you can
have them with the teachers.

Thank you very much, Mr. Xie.

This is one of the oldest
blank verse of our country.

The Cilechuan Plain is below the Yinshan Mountain.(Cile:
an ancient nationality in the Chines North)

The sky is like gers which are all over the
plain.

The sky is dark green and the plain is
boundless.

The grass bends when the wind sweeps
and one sees the cattle and sheep.

Three years later, I graduated from this
school.

Owing to the shortage of teachers then, I was
kept by the school and became a teacher.

The motherland, the people, the labor and
the nature gave me the courage to live on.

What happened 30 years ago made
me feel more and more disturbed.

In the mainland, one's family background was of great importance.
And there had been class struggle all the time.

And you are an orphan.

Only if I were an orphan.

I am not an orphan.

I am an abandoned son.

An abandoned son

As a father, you wanted
happiness.You wanted freedom.

Have you ever thought about your
responsibility as a father

Go on.

I know that life is not easy for you.

You suffered 20 years
because of our family.

As a father, I have a guilty conscience.

Lingiun, our country has a history of
feudalism for a few thousand years.

I was forced to separate with my child.

You can't understand me
a little bit, can you

You are a 40-year-old man.

But I still have to put your in the cradle.

I want to reestablish your value as a human
being.

I want to reestablish your faith

I died once, but I revived.

I not only have found the value of being a
human being, but also the warmth.

I have found a father and a mother.

I will never forget what
they have given me.

1962 In 1962, my labor education came to an
end.

Because I had no home to go back to, they
let me stay at the rangeland to work.

Grandpa.

Ah Oh

Grandpa, Yo“

The screen can shield the wind.

Wind coming at night from Qilian mountains
chills one's bones.

Please have a seat.

Ok.

Cigarette.

I like tobacco.

I am not used to this.
Keep it for your guests.

Dad.

What

Dinner is ready.

I will go home soon.

Open the door.

I am holding the bowls.

Oops, this old woman.Usually,
she won't heat the meal for me.

And today she is sending it here.

It's not for you.

No wonder you bring two.

A Jun, come and eat.

Hey, I only brought one pair of chopsticks.

Oh, they are both for you.

A Jun, eat it.

No, no. Grandma, I am not hungry.

Look, I still have some bun.

Eat it when it is Warm. There
is still plenty at my home.

When you are full, you won't be homesick.

Eat it. Eat it when it is still warm.

Let's go.

In the future, if you need anything, go and
take it at my home.

We live in the same
place.We are like family.

One should look into the future.

Even Li Long zheng (an emperor of the Ming
Dynasty) used to be a monk.

Stop babbling.

Eat it. Eat it when it is still warm.

When you are full, you won't be homesick.

One should look into the future.

Life is beautiful after all.

Mother Nature and labor have given me many
things that I can't get in the class.

In this simple and natural labor, a
beautiful feeling was aroused in my heart.

I seemed to be melting into this group of
unpretentious people.

Everything in the past
became a vague dream.

Sweep away all bad elements.

What's wrong with you

Nothing.

[Le lin]Order.

[Jun, you are to report to the
panel of authority in the range]

If not, mind your dog head.

Le jin. [The speaker mistakes
le lin(order) as le jin].

Mind your dog head.

We have been with Lingiun for some years.We
know him well.

He is honest and works hard.

We can't just let him go to suffer.

Indeed. Well, without more
ado, tell him to run away.

Oops, where can he run to

If he is captured, he will be treated as an
escaped criminal.

Well, I have an idea. So long as we insist that the
situation of the grass on the rangeland is not sound.

Oh.

It hasn't rained since spring began three
months ago.The grass hasn't germinated by now.

The horses have all become thin.

Indeed.

I don't think we can still graze them here.

Yes.

Yes.

Indeed.

Well, if you can report to the authorities that so long as they will
take responsibility if the horses die, we won't go up the mountains.

Or let the horses starve to death.

Lao Wang, as the saying goes, March is the
worse time for the cattle.

The grassland down here is too dry this year. Get
them to the mountains while there is still time.

In a short time, the horse will be too weak to walk by
then, even if you want to cry, you won't have tears.

Sigh, the rangeland authority
doesn't have any leaders now.

Who can I go to ask for help

Well, you haven't been dismissed from office.
You are still head of the rangeland.

You are the team leader here.

That's right.

You can give the order.

We support you.

You should be the leader.

Ok. Ok.

Well, what shank! we do about Xu Lingjun

The authority of the rangeland has called three times
to urge him to report to the rehabilitation class.

Great. Ask the insurrectionists
to send someone to replace him.

Oops, how can that be

Well, Uncle Dong, you can get Xu Lingiun's
herd of horses to the mountains.

Me

Right.

What Let a poor old peasant go up the mountains while
a young rightist stay at home to enjoy a happy life

I don't mean that.

What is your class emotion

What is your class emotion

What do you mean

Ok. Ok. Ok.I will take charge this time.
You can all go.All go.

Let's go.

Go.

Let's go. To the mountains.

Let's go.

Let's go.

We are going.

Lingiun, do you have any leather coat

Here, take mine.

Lingiun, remember these seven characters.

Believe in the masses, trust the Party.

Lao Guo.

Ah Oh.

Hey guys, to the mountains.

To the Qilian Mountains.

To the Qianlian Mountains and graze the
horses.

Let's rush towards Qilian Mountains.

To the Qilian Mountains.

But for these kind and unsophisticated
people, I wouldn't be able to see you now.

It is china from Junzhou (an ancient place
famous for its china)

The place of production is Yuxian in Henan
Province, the site of Junzhou in the Song Dynasty.

But this is only an imitation.

The color is quiet nice.

How much

800 Yuan.

The color is call blood red of Junzhou.

Well, buy one.

Ask what he wants to buy.

Ok. Lingiun, take whatever you like.

Father, I don't need anything.

Ah. dishware, tea-things. Pick some.

Please give me one of those pickle jugs.

Ok.

This one.

Yes.

4.5 Yuan.

Ok.

Mr. Xu, you like eating pickle

My wife likes.She is from Sichuan Province.

Your wife must be very beautiful.

Haha. It's a pity that she isn't here.

You will know that when you see her.

A naive girl.

A naive girl? What a sweet name.

Marriage per se is a
contract and obligation.

Whether there is feeling between you and your wife,
you have to carry out the contract to the end.

Otherwise, your conscience will be
disturbed and it will cause regret.

Thanks.

Well, her name is XiuXiu

Li Xiuzhi.

Oh, Li Xiuzhi.

Do you have her photo with you

She just mailed one to me.
Taken in the town centre.

But it isn't very well taken. Here.

Yes.How old is the kid

5 years old.

Pretty. She looks like Yamaguchi Momoe.

This time, you can bring your wife and your
child to the United States.

I am afraid.

There must be a touching love story between
you two.

Mr. Xu, would you like to tell us your love
story

We don't have any love stories.When we got
married, we still didn't know each other.

Oh

You can say that we began to
talk about love after marriage.

Oh, that must be more interesting.I like it
this Way.

In the States, marriage
is the grave of love.

It's not fun at all.

Do tell us about your love story.

There is really nothing much to tell.

It's very simple.

Father and Miss Sun can tell the mixture of
bitterness and sweetness of coffee.

But how can they tell the mixture of
bitterness and sweetness of life

which is a peculiar and accidental
combination.

Where are you from

Sichuan.

Oh, ﬂeeing from famine.

Yes.

Don't you have any relatives here

I have a cousin here.

Oh.

She wrote to tell me to come here.

She had a lover.

But he died in a car accident last month.

Oh, he was in your team, the 6th team.

Oh, I know.

Then what are you going to do

I don't know.

Uncle, there are good people in the world.

Would you find me a place
where I can make a living

I can work.

How about I find a husband for you

You are going like this

Let's talk about it when
you find a suitable one.

This one is not bad.

Oops. She is too thin and weak.

Let's go.

You don't say.lt's really difficult to find
anybody for them.

Saying that she is too thin, too weak.

When you ﬂed from famine from Henan and came here, the
upper part of your body was not fully developed yet.

Look at you now.

One will grow as time goes by.

Hey, Kali, wait.

What

Well, how about Lingiun

The man is over 30 now and doesn't have a
wife.

Their sizes match.

That's not important.

But he was a rightist.

A rightist A rightist also
have the right to have a wife.

The tag of rightist has been removed from
him.And he has a job on the farm.

Oops, why didn't I thing about him

Ok.

Lao Xu, do you want a wife

Well, as long as you say Yes, I will bring
one to you right away.

Ah

Then bring one.

Ok. It's a deal.

Tidy up your house.

Oops.

The girl has got a certificate.

As to you, I am going to the Political
Department now and get one for you.

Look at you.

Come, take it off.

I will bring you a wife when I come back.

Hey, get yourself ready for it.

Tonight is the night for your wedding.

A beggar.

Hey, you nasty kids. Off.Off.Off.

Hey, go to play. Go to play. Go to play.

A beggar.

Go, go, go. Go to play.

Go. Go. Go.

Don't be afraid.

Go. Go. Go.

Well, it's really tiring.

I ran non-stop for 15 kilometers back and
forth this afternoon.

You didn't give me any wine. But at
least you should give me some water.

Well, why don't you come in Come in.

Come on in.

Come on in.

This is your home.

Well, he is Lao Xu.

The name is Xu Lingjun.

Don't laugh.Go away.

Everything is fine but a little bit poor.

But, the poorer, the
easier to get used to it.

This is really a big joke.

This isn't a joke at all.

It's serious.

I've got the certificate.

Marriage certificate.

This is law.

Law.Do you know

I got it on behalf of you.

If you stop it halfway, it's very no fun.

You are married now.

How can this be

How can this not be

She is already here.

How can this be

How can this not be

Ok. Enjoy your married life.

Have a son next year. And remember to invite
to a feast, to make up for your wedding feast.

Hey, what are you peering at Haven't
you seen your father and mother marry

Go. Go. Go. Go back and tell
your father and mother.

Go. Go. Go. Go ahead.

You have some water.

You walked a long journey.

You eat something.

I have cooked some porridge.

You eat.I am not hungry.

You eat.You've work the whole day.

You eat.

Let's share it.

Ah Ok.

Oops. This bowl is the only one I have.

I can use this to eat.

Ok.

What did you laugh at

You can really make the best of things.

Which city of Sichuan are you from

Jiangyou.

Why are there so many people ﬂeeing from
famine in your place

There is violence everyday.
Nobody works the land.

Who else are there in your family

Father, mother and two brothers.

How could they let you leave home

Don't be grieved.The herdsmen in our
rangeland are all very good people.

Let me do it.

No. I can do it.

Give it to me. I will wash it.

Why do you have to wash it

Before I came, my mother told me to be
diligent.

Do you have a post office here

Yes.Why asking

I want to write a letter to my mother.

Tell her I have found a home.

Let's talk about it tomorrow.

You are tired.Have a wash.

I have to feed the horses.

He is coming out. Go.

Xiao Sha, go home.

Are you homesick

This is the 40 Yuan I have saved.

And a ticket for 20 Jin rice.

Take it with you and go home. I...

You think I am ugly, don't you

No. no. no.it's Kazi
its nothing.

II

I am a rightist.

Uncle Guo told me that they said
that you are not a bad person.

Why are you crying

I am not good at words.

Such a kind person was put into my life
suddenly.

The day for which I had been
waiting for years finally came.

She trusted me that much.

There wasn't any feeling of strangeness.

She seemed to have waited for me for many
years too.

Put on your clothes.

I forgot to ask you your name.

My name is Li Xiuzhi.

Xiuzhi.

Xiuzhi, I am a person who has committed a
crime.

Then let's not commit any from now on.

I am destined to labor here all my life.

What's wrong with that
I will accompany you.

That's too pitiful.

I am not pitiable, I have a good fate.

Why

I can see that I have met a good man.

Really

Yes.

Kazi, Xiuzhi is pretty and
small.lt's a match for him.

According to reason, we all eat the
same kind of grain around here.

Grandpa.

They will be really settled when they get a
child.

Take him.

All is good but the man
is a little bit old.

What the heck do you know The older the man
is, the better he cares about his wife. Right

You can ask Grandpa Dong about this.

Go. Go. Go.Are you new here

Yo, the bridegroom is coming.

Let's see whether the
bridegroom is changed or not.

The bridegroom is here.

Lingiun, how about it

Xiuzhi said, Invite them all to our house
tonight.

Even if you are treated with only water.
Just to show our kindly feeling.

Ok. Tonight, we will celebrate Lingiun's
wedding.

Good.

This is called a formal marriage.

A formal marriage.

This girl must be God-sent.

Indeed.

Lingiun.

Here you are.

Lao Guo, please come in.

Sister Xiuzhi.

Yes.

Lingiun, it's good now.You
have a family now.

Congratulations, bride.

Sister Xiuzhi, did you make this

Yo, is this Lingiun's house
It's like he has a new house.

Indeed.

And the paper-cuts.

Alas, and the paper-cuts.

Auntie, as the saying goes, a home
without a wife is not really a home.

Men don't know how to take care of a house.

Hey, Niu Fengying.

Yes

Don't bring ways of your house here.

What the hell. Mind your tongue.

Hold my son.A kiss.

Does it snow in your place

Yes.But it melts the moment it touches the
ground.

How do you cook your rice

Porridge and cooked rice. The same as here.

Let me have a look.

Auntie.

Pretty.

The face is as white as egg shell.

Auntie, have a seat.

Ok.

I have brought you a boiler. It's big
enough to cook a meal for two people.

Auntie, no, thanks.

Well, I don't use it now.

Saving you from buying a new one.

It's not easy to organize a family.

Come. Sit by me.

Come in

Hey, Lingiun, come. A word.

This is the money our team gave
you.Five Jiao from each family.

Altogether, there are 23.5 Yuan.

Well, this can't be.

Lingiun, take it. Take it. Just to show our
kindly feeling.

The gift is petty, but
the affection is not.

Accept it. Take her to the shop
and buy a new coat for her.

Right

Yes.

It's a once-a-life issue.

Hey, I have a suggestion. According to the law, We will
give Brother Xu a three-day holiday for the marriage.

What do you say

Yes.

I will graze his horses for the time being.

I want to say something.

Today is the wedding day for
Xu Lingiun and Li Xiuying.

Oops. It's Li Xiuzhi.

Oh. Right.

Their marriage is also a happy
event for the seventh team.

Look, he's got a bottle a Wine here. And
candies.

We don't drink wine
0ften.You also have some.

Cheers.

Where did you get these
tickets for cloth and rice

It's from everybody.

Look there, and two bags of rice.

Human beings are good-natured after all.

This is how we made our poor family.

What surprised me was Xiuzhi.

A girl 15 years younger than me. There is
such a great creativity stored inside her.

Yo, you made all these adobes.

Yes.

Well, how was your work

Give me.

You were away for ten days. And I have made
2000.

Why did you make so many adobes

To set up a fence walLWe will make a fence
wall.

Besides, I want to build
a small house here.

Tomorrow, I will go to
graze the horses with you.

Silly girl. No women of the Han
people can go to graze the horses.

I just want to go.

I will make myself look like a man.

You are away for ten days every time.
Even the horses are homesick.

But you are not.

Stay at home and make more adobes. Ah

Yes

Well, you make adobes in the day.You should
read some books in the evening.

You are talking to me like I am a child.

Hey, I have something to show you.

Don't laugh at me.

Look.

Yo, you are writing your diary.

Read it.

Today, I dug an aspen from the wild
country in front of the door, I.

I borrowed a cart from the Niu Fengying's and
brought the tree back and planted it in the yard.

Back in my hometown, there are trees
in front of everybody's house.

People can't see the sky the
moment they walk out of the door.

Today, Xinghua came and asked
me to go to the movies.

The movie was called oh, Lenin in 1918.

We don't have any milk. Nor do we have any
bread. What can we feed her with

Don't be sad.Don't cry.We will have them.
We will have them all. We will have bread.

I must go now.

Now

Now.

You haven't eaten anything, have you

No, of course not.

When Lingiun is back, I will tell him these
words.

We will have bread.We will have everything.

Today, the horse Daqingma ran back from the
meadow in the mountains.

Grandpa Dong said that the horse came back
because it missed its home.

Sigh, even a horse will miss its home.
But the man doesn't.

Xu

Xu Lingiun, you are really hard to me.

Ouch.

Today, I borrowed a book,
Sanliwan Bay, from Doctor Niu.

Lingiun said that this novel is very good.

I, a fourth-grade primary school students
should read it.

Well, why don't you let me go on

The rest of it is about making adobes,
I don't know how to write the word.

Tu (earth), bu (no), Yiheng (a line). [these three words
put together form the Chinese character for adobe]

You perverse thing.Wait a moment.

Qingqing's mother. Work's done.

Yes.Come and have a rest here.

No, thanks.

Qingqing's mother, no wonder they all call you the Commander of the Navy, the land force and
the air force.(she raises all kinds of animals, in the water, in the sky and on the and)

Whatever you raise, you are successful.

And you have brought up your son Qingqing
well.

That's because of my milk.

Qingqing.

Whatever I raise, I am successful.

Whatever I raise, I am successful.

We will have bread.We will have everything.

A song for the Cilechuan Plain.

The Cilechuan Plain is below the Yinshan Mountain.(Cile:
an ancient nationality in the Chines North)

The sky is like gers which are all over the
plain.

The sky is `dark green` and the plain is `boundless`.

The grass bends when the wind sweeps and one sees the cattle and sheep.

This is the place.This is it.

It hasn't changed.

The gate is still the gate of our former
school.

It's been a few ten years.

Indeed.

Are you Xiao Gushun

1 am Xu Jinyou. Do you still remember

I was in Class Two.

Yes.Yes.

I still remember that you know how to light
the gas lamp.

Now we have electric lights.

Oh, these two buildings were built later.

Ah.

All the glass was smashed
during the Cultural Revolution.

None was left intact.
To smash the Four Olds.

Now everything is all right. All have been
redressed.

The teachers, the classrooms, the
chairs and the desks.All are redressed.

Dear students, last time, we talked about
Qinghai Province.

Today, we are going to talk about Gansu, a
province at the upper reaches of the Yellow River.

53 The area of Gansu is
over 530 thousand km 2.

The `ancient name` for it is Long.

`Mr. Xu, this is your career on the rangeland`

Yes.

`Being a teacher in such a desolate place.Don't you feel dull`

`It's a very interest thing to spread civilization in those places.`

`The oases on the desert are very lovely.`

`Mr. Xu, I like your personality.`

But can your wife understand you

`Human beings are the most advanced of all the living things.`

`There is a very small difference in their intelligence.`

`Experience itself is also part of civilization.`

Oh.

The sky is still the same.
But the people are not.

When one returns, he knows the former
situation better.

I didn't think that I could still see Xiao
Gushun.

Even he knows the word redress

Interesting.

Lingiun.

Lingiun.

Yes.

Lingiun.

The rangeland authority wants you
to go to the Political Department.

Go when you have finished your meal.

What's the matter

I don't know how to tell you clearly.

Anyway, it's something good.

Have dinner with us.

No, thanks.

Hey, go and see Director Zhong.

Oh.

What's the matter

Never mind it. Whatever.
Have your meal first.

Am not eating.

Look at you.What are you afraid of

For one thing, we haven't stolen anything.
For another, we haven't robbed anybody.

And the Gang of Four is no more.
They can't do what they want.

The central government
nowadays let the people speak.

According to the decision of the central government,
we are wrong in labeling you as a rightist.

We will redress your case.

Considering that you don't have any family members in your
hometown, we have found you a position in Fuchang Primary School.

500 Besides, you have 500 Yuan for compensation.
Go and get it from the Finance Department.

The transfer order is in next door, in Lao
Tang's hand.

Report yourself to the school tomorrow.

If you have any other difficulties, come to
me.

We fully understand your feeling.

You have behaved yourself in the past 20
years.

Ok. Go home and get some rest.

Ok.

Go and tell your classmates.

That Mr. Xu will come to be a
teacher in your school tomorrow.

Don't call him rightist anymore.

Ok.

Remember it.

He is a teacher. A rightist mistaken.

Ok.

He is not really a rightist.

Change your mouth first.

I will call him Mr. Xu from now on.

Xiuzhi, from now on, we are the same as
everybody else.

Hey, what are you doing there

What's wrong with me I
can't count it clearly.

I have counted it many times.So much money.

Oops. Look at you.Money is not important.

What is important is that I was wronged
politically.

Wronged politically

In my eyes, you are still you.

Mama, how did father get so much money

A compensate for being a
rightist for twenty years.

Mama, I want to be a
rightist when I grow up.

I will make much money.

I will buy a pair of leather shoes for you.

Like Xiao song's mother's.

Hey, Mr. Xu, come and hear what
your precious son is saying.

Qingqing.

Papa, I won't be a rightist when I grow up.

I will be a teacher.

Good morning.

Stand up.

Good morning, sir.

Good morning, boys and girls.

Sit down, please.

Me, you all know me.

I am not good at speaking.

Today, we are going to learn Lesson One.

The title is.

Our great motherland.

Please open your books.

Lingiun, my son Xiao Gen said that you had
given an excellent lesson.

Thank you.

Certainly.We saw him read a lot all these
years.

Indeed.

I said this before. An educated person is not good at
farm work but they just stuffed him into the stable.

And both the farm work and
his education are delayed.

Really. Even I was assigned to the school to be a
representative of the middle peasant for three months.

It was such an agony that my neck ached.

What book is this It's so thick.

Grandpa, this is a dictionary.

It's used to look up words.Even
you don't know this.

What are you laughing at

I have lived all my life as an illiterate.

Sigh. I even can't understand a movie.

I only see the people moving.

That time, Daqingma, the horse, was sick. I
went to the vet to get some medicine.

I mistook the invoice as the prescription.

Knowledge is need everywhere.

In the future, even raising cows and horses
will need knowledge.

Now matter what you do, technology will be
needed.

We poor peasants are
done for this life time.

But these kids depend on you.

Lingiun, everything considered, we have
been grazing horses for so many years.

This little grandson of mine,
please do your best to educate him.

Beat him when necessary.Lecture him when
necessary.

Please rest assured.I will
do my best to teach them.

Yo, you are all here.

You are home.

Yes.

Ma. Ma.

Xiuzhi, what delicacies are
you going to cook for Mr. Xu.

What delicacies

Fried mushroom. Cured meat I brought
from my hometown in Sichuan.

And beer.

All of you stay for dinner. Auntie
Niu, come and help me cut the meat.

Help her cut the meat.

Xiuzhi, you really should invite me to some
beer.

Mr. Xu not only has been redressed, but
also has become an official teacher.

Whether he is a teacher or not is not important.
In my eyes, he is still Xu Lingiun.

Even if he becomes an official,
it's nothing special to me.

Even if he will raise horses for another 20
years, I won't dislike him.

Anyway, I don't think he has ever
opposed the Party and Socialism.

I redressed him the day
when I married him.Not now.

500 Oh What's the use of your redress You
can't give him 500 Yuan.

I have given him my heart.

It's more precious than money.

Xiuzhi, I am missing you again What are you
doing now

Playing with Qingqing, or missing me too

I have thought much in the past few days.

Why didn't commit suicide
during the Cultural Revolution

Because I trust the power of the people.

I do believe that history is made by the
people.

Why do I continue to live today

I do believe, too, that our ancient motherland
has the capacity for a change for the good.

In my opinion, the children you have in the
States are no comparison to him.

He is firm, perseverant,
and self-possessed.

San Francisco If he is to take over San Francisco Chemical
Company, he will bring development to your career.

Make hay while the sun shines. You should
invest more in cultivating him.

Try to enlighten him in his ability for
competition and his ability for management.

He won't necessarily be interested in it.

This is not likely.

You are brought up in the States. You don't
understand the Chinese.

I will have a good talk with him again.

Xiuzhi, I remember, in the evening before I
came to Beijing, you asked:

What cadre is your father
in the United States

A capitalist also called an entrepreneur.

Then he must have a lot of money.

Most likely. People say
he is a billionaire.

He owns 6 or 7 large companies
in the United States only.

How much is one hundred million

Maybe enough to buy ten thousand cars.

Oops. So much money.

Why does one need so much money

How much can an old man eat one day

Father, I want a car.

I want a car.

Good-for nothing.

Li said to mama. That is grandpa's money.

Only money earned by our own hands can we spend it
comfortably only in this way can we have an easy conscience.

Like the money I used to buy salt I know I
earned it by selling eggs.

Right

The money I used to buy chili.I
know I earned it by cutting rice.

The money I used to buy cartoon books for you.I
know I earned it by working for others overtime.

Never take a penny that doesn't belong to
us. This is called moral integrity.

Moral integrity.

Hey, I say, don't take so many
eggs cooked in tea and sauce.

Only to show my kindly feeling.

Even if I have just stood for one night with you
by the Kang, I am still his daughter-in-law.

I haven't cooked a meal for my father-in-law.
Some eggs for him won't be too many.

Xiuzhi, if my father asks me to go to the
United States, what should I do

Just go.

There, you will have a nice house to live in. you
will have a car to ride. And you can dance disco.

So long as you are happy I can endure any
hardship.

If he asks the whole family to go

I won't go.

China is such a large country.Why
go and live in a foreign country

Then I have no choice but to go by myself
first.

Hey, how about asking Guo Kazi to find you
another husband

Bastard.

Don't frighten me. You won't go.
I know it in my heart.

Why Do you think that I
can't live without you

I am not that powerful.

I know you hate to part with
the kids in the school.

You hate to part with the country folks.Guo Kazi. Uncle Dong.
Moreover, you hate to part with her.

You look at her everyday.

You can take it down and put it in your
pocket and take it away but it is empty.

You can't take Qilianshan Mountains with
you.Neither can you take the grassland away.

In my hometown, people say: the son won't mind his poor mother.
The dog won't mind his master's poor home.

Xiuzhi.

You are not in bed yet.

Oh. Father.

I am writing to Xiuzhi.

Can I read it

Yes.

Xiuzhi, I have undergone all kinds of
sufferings in the past few ten years.

It seems that a person like me, who has such a
rich father, should really leave this country.

But my answer is No.

I have waited for twenty years.This day has
finally come.

I have seen the prospect of the motherland.

I have sown my sweat and
my tears for twenty years.

I can't leave when the
people are advancing.

We don't just live to eat.

So you have made up your mind

Yes. Father. I have made up my mind.

I have come back late.

Yes. Father.

If you had come back five years earlier, I
might have gone with you.

Now our country is on the right way, I am
willing to climb the slope with the people.

Is it so attractive

You can't experience when their
country rises from turmoil.

The excitement of the people

The aim of the revolution
is to improve one's life.

It is an exciting life to change the
fate of one billion poor people.

There are two possibilities for everything.

One is success.The other is failure.

Have you ever thought about that

I have thought about it.

But I trust that our nation will succeed.

Father, I am a forty-year-old man.

Please do believe that the belief of a
forty-year-old man won't be so naive.

I have read books written
by Marx and Lenin.

And books written by Hegel and Russell.

And books written by Einstein.

I don't want to be a slave to money.

I am not interest in that.

It looks like that you
are a firm socialist.

Every one has his own ambition.
I won't push you.

Oh. You have some.

I can see you this time. I am really happy.

I find that you are very
firm and perseverant.

This is good.

Considering everything, I have seen you.

Here I have an anthology of Maupassant.

There is a story about a councilor meeting again his
son who was born in the early stage of his life.

Who knows that his son has become an idiot.

This made me think that you would appear in
front of me in a shabby appearance.

Now I have seen what you really look
like, I won't worry about you anymore.

I have a request. Can I see little Qingqing

To you, I didn't fulfill my
responsibility as a father.

To him, I want to.

Yes. Father.

We will have many chances to see him.

I hope you can come to the grassland, to the rangeland
to have a look. Qingqing can accompany you.

If it is so, I will appreciate it.

I am old now.As long as wealth is
concerned, I am a billionaire.

When it comes to love, I am as poor as a
church mouse.

To be more exact, I am a beggar.

Father.

In the United States, you have two brothers
and a sister.

But they are all like the name
of an American magazine Playboy.

Wealth can't build a palace of love among
family members.

Say thanks to your wife for me.

She is lovely.

She will look after you for me.

Lingiun, I want to ask
you to do me a favor.

Can you buy me a grave, 2 meters
in length and 1 meter in width

I still want to be buried in China.

Father, don't be so sick at heart.

Xiuzhi and I will go to
see you in two years.

Oh, Xiuzhi asked me to bring two
packages of Chinese wolf berry.

Father, look.

Chinese wolfberry I know. I know.

For Xiuzhi.

Oops. Such a nice Watch.She Won't need it.

Don't mind it. This is to show my kindly
feeling.

Ok.

Mr. Xu, your ﬂight is

12 o'clock.

Oh.

Never mind. I will see you off first.

Chairman of the Board, you can
close your eyes and get some rest.

We still have half-an-hour's ride.

No need. I want to have
another look at Beijing

Beijing.One week. A dream.

No. better than a dream.

Passengers to San Francisco.
Attention please.

Write to me often.

Communication nowadays is very convenient.

Take some photos of Qingqing
and mail them to me.

Ok. I will.

I have finished the procedure.

Ok.

Hope I can see you again.

Me too.

Say hello to your wife.

Oh. Thank you.

Let's go.

Let me have another look at you.

Father, so long.

Father said that I am very self-possessed.
He didn't really understand me.

I think, sometimes, feeling
is the basis for faith.

I have sweated this land.

I have friends on this land who have gone
through thick and thin with me.

I have my wife here. We depend
on each other for survival.

I have the root of my life here.

The End

文化太低啊，

资产阶级，

就是用文化，

来卡我们，

文化低，

能怪我们吗？

不能这笔账，

只能算在国民党地主资产阶级身上，

解放刚刚九年，

要那么高的文化上供大实质上是把工农子弟拒之门外，

有人说上大学要有资格，

什么是资格啊，

资产阶级有他资产阶级资格无产阶级有我们无产阶级资格进共产主义劳动大学，

第一条资格，

就是劳动人民，

这手上的硬件，

就是资格，

贫下中农同志吧，

你们说，

他够不够资格呀，

请聊这个，

副校长这样的招生法行吗？

怎么不行啊，

曹校长一再强调，

银很少照质量要高，

对一些学生，

质量都不错嘛，

我不能理解，

这样的招生法我也从来没有见过，

然后代表，

是党员吗土改那年入的党，

对山区的青年人都熟吗叫得出名字啊，

我们请你当招考委员怎么样呃不行不行我这个穿草鞋的怎么能当招考委员呢呵呵呵呵呵呵呵呵不行不行啊，

穿草鞋怎么不行啊，

过去八路军新四军就是穿草鞋打败了国内外反动派，

就是要你这个穿草鞋的，

老代表当张浩伟好，

校党委研究一下这个门呐就请你来把啊，

同学们带来喝水啊，

金凤姐金凤姐金凤姐给我来我来吧，

龙校长哎来了哎，

快领去吧，

鱼竿，

龙厂长哦不龙校长炮兵排长于刚前来报到于刚啊，

你现在是农机系的班主任了我啊，

龙校长，

我先去了你去吧好，

我们学校有没有教学大楼有，

图书馆呢有学业大楼呢也有我们学校在哪儿，

你们看我们学校就在那，

迟到的好处答案，

老爸都是他的了害他的，

啊呀嘞，

哎呀嘞，

姐姐帮我点好了但求命根喽嘿，

工农群众当上了，

当了大学生诶，

哎哎哎哎哎哎哎，

哎哎哎哎哎哎，

路上的大街上，

哎放下放下你怎么把那珠子也给砍下来了，

我我我砍的全是粗竹子啊你以为粗的就是老的这细的就是嫩的，

你还是个老师呢，

给你擦一擦汗都流到嘴里去了，

汗流到嘴里是咸的，

留到心里是甜的，

哈哈哈哈哈哈哈说得好说得好啊肖老师，

老代表收下我这个学生吧行啊，

走我带你们砍竹子去看一看脑袋表，

我也去龙校长，

我大名上工大了好啊小妹，

那我从今天起就是工大的学生了欢迎你啊欢迎小麦龙校长你在延安也搭过竹棚吗？

不那个时候是挖窑洞呢，

那为什么不搭竹棚呢，

延安没有竹子啊龙校长那你就给我们讲讲延安吧，

好，

我给你们讲一讲，

延安看大坝，

那个时候是战争年代，

延安抗大，

都是自己挖窑洞，

自己开荒搞大生产，

自己纺线织布，

条件是非常艰苦啊，

那个时候也没有课堂，

一人一个背包，

坐在窑洞的前面，

听伟大领袖毛主席，

给我们讲课，

那个情景啊，

到现在我还记得，

那真是振奋人心呐，

他们多幸福啊今天我们的供大，

就是要按照抗大的样子办，

先上马后备鞍，

不要国家一分钱，

用我们的双手，

把咱们的学校办起来呀，

唉真不理解，

偏偏要在这山沟里办大学，

又是开路又是建校舍还要自己种粮食啊，

哪里像办大学，

这简直是很慌对，

是啊把学生蒙在这山沟里头，

见不到世面，

就能培养出高精尖的人才，

这就是活见鬼，

你看看这才是真正的大学呢多宏伟呀那座大高楼是干什么的，

教学楼，

呵真漂亮啊，

这一座呢，

图书馆，

哎呀我的妈呀这么高啊，

我是杨志豪，

别看你额头长得高，

还带着副眼镜，

真傻城里放着高楼大厦不住跑到山沟里来住草棚切这哪有点大学的样子，

谁在那说话呢，

哎呀是龙啸茶啊，

啊是杨志豪啊楼下的，

你们在谈什么样的大学呢嗯，

我看看好吗？

啊看一个学校的好坏不能只看有没有高楼大厦也不能看有没有专家教授，

要看这个学校培养什么样的学生，

当年在延安的窑洞里，

抗大为中国革命培养了大批干部，

今天我们在这山沟里，

要培养革命事业的接班人呢，

学习上有困难吗？

同学们进步很快学习的都很好很好啊，

要刻苦的学习，

认真读书啊，

咱们共产主义劳动大学培养的人才，

既要有共产主义觉悟，

又要有学问还会生产劳动，

成为又红又专的大学生啊，

曹校长教学大纲搞出来了好，

啊根据你的意见，

我们把全国名牌大学甚至外国的好经验都吸收进来了，

很好吧，

是要有这么点雄心壮志才行，

只要按照这个大纲教学教出来的学生绝不比别人差那当然喽，

不过大批的工农同学怎么办，

他们都能跟得上吗？

不考虑这个问题，

跟不上就自然淘汰，

这是个规律，

龙校长这个人可真有意思，

他凭着手上两个硬件来收学生，

老龙是个工农干部，

修铁路办林场还是蛮有一套的，

可是搞教育嘛，

呵呵呵呵，

要说搞教育工作曹校长不愧是党内的专家，

有能力有气魄，

有曹校长领导教训大家是信心百倍，

哎不不不，

我不过是上了几天教育学院多读了几本书，

也是个半平之处，

办教育嘛，

还得靠你们这些行家哟哪里哪里，

不过，

这个教学大纲，

还没有征求龙校长的意见，

我的意见，

这个教学大纲要发动全校师生充分讨论，

小平老师你刚才说课程太多对，

我是全日制大学出来的我有体会我们在学校的时候全天读书都完不成这些课程，

现在是半工半读更难以完成，

只能让同学赶上大纲，

不能降低标准让大纲来迁就同学，

孔夫子三千弟子也不过出了七十二千人嘛，

啊对，

孔老二没什么了不起，

既不会种田又不会做工，

他培养的学生是骑在劳动人民头上的精神贵族，

今天我们培养的是无产阶级崭新的一代，

绝不是培养几个所谓的尖子就行了，

这是方向我同意，

我们共产主义劳动大学是半工半读绝不能照搬全日制那一套同意孙主任，

你的意见呢，

据我二十多年的教学经验，

我认为只有按照这个教学大纲，

才能培养出高质量的人才，

大家对教学大纲都发表了意见，

我们共产主义劳动大学要走抗大的路，

咱们的教学大纲不能照搬全日制要闯出一条新路，

咱们床法，

大家都没有经验，

但是有一条要牢牢的记住，

我们培养的人才，

必须是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，

龙校长龙校长这是我们农机系的，

呵这么多书啊，

这些你从哪弄来的，

从曹校长孙主任那搬来的，

你都看过了，

看了看他干什么都是些资产阶级的玩意儿，

要我说呀来个万炮齐轰全轰掉他轰掉，

哈哈哈哈哈哈哈，

你这个炮兵排长啊净放空炮，

你知道敌人的火力点在哪吗啊，

不知道吧，

我们学校的许多做法，

都是从这里来的，

从这里嗯，

你看看毛主席是怎么说的，

教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，

必须同生产劳动相结合，

通过这一段时间，

我对毛主席这一教导，

要有深刻的理解，

你想想，

我们党办的大学，

可是教学好多还是资产阶级那一套，

你说这能行吗？

我明白了，

咦我也去侦查侦查，

哈哈哈哈哈哈，

前几天，

我给大家讲了，

马的呼吸系统，

马的消化系统，

和马的骨骼特征，

今天，

我要给大家讲一讲，

马尾巴的功能，

这个马尾巴，

老大爷你怎么把牛牵到这儿来了，

老师我是山边生产队的，

队里这头牛病了想请老师给看看，

我们这是学校，

快把你们牵走牵远一点，

啊啊啊啊啊啊，

啊，

同学们都记完了吗？

好现在我们就讲一讲，

马尾巴的，

是这么回事，

我们队里最好的一头水牛从前天起，

发烧不吃草，

听说老师高明得让我先来让老师给看看呃我们这是大学不是兽医站，

快走吧老师春耕到了，

队里等着用油，

给治治吧老大爷，

请你不要他让我们上课，

老师给治治吧你不要多嘴，

快走吧，

现在我们就接着讲，

马尾巴，

你站起来讲话，

我提个意见，

你把扣子扣上，

说吧学校是不是准备派我们到内蒙去养马呢，

严肃一点，

上课都几个月了您总是讲嘛，

可我们这儿很少，

特别是山区就更没有马，

就连这匹既不会叫也不会跳的石膏马我也是第一次看见，

再说您讲的我也听不懂，

叫什么？

越是听不懂，

就说明学问越深呐，

那就更应该学嘛，

你们看中国的蒙古马，

非洲的斑马，

世界上各种各样的马，

我们都要讲到，

懂吗坐下，

我的意见还没有提完简短一些，

我建议改变课程，

少讲点马多讲点猪和牛完了，

你站起来我提完了，

站起来既然你不愿意听课，

你可以出去，

我这是提意见，

出去出去也要提意见，

大家都好，

下面我们接着讲，

马尾巴的，

功能，

居哉我教了这么多年书，

没有见过你这样的学生，

你把课程全搞乱了，

以后不要再乱提意见了，

你看看你惹出多大的一场风波，

去吧把大字报撕下来，

快去，

难道错了吗？

没错牛仔，

你看牛仔你做的对，

咱把它贴上，

哎跟刚才那张一样的，

哎呀曹校长要知道了非k他不可，

举牛仔，

去牛仔，

我不是让你撕下来吗怎么又贴上一张大的曹校长牛仔的大字报说的对呀，

不行马上给我时间等一等，

不要撕嘛，

老曹这张大字报写的蛮好嘛，

为什么要撕掉呢，

这张大字报把我们的教学全冲乱了，

一张小小的大字报，

就能把教学冲乱，

正说明他集中了要害，

老龙啊，

我们这一套并不是自己发明的，

全国农业大学的课程都是这么安排的嘛那说明这张大字报的意义更大了，

老头啊，

啊你看，

这又是一张很好的大字报，

小平老师呢龙校长我在这儿，

这些稻种怎么会烂掉呢，

这种催芽时温度太高了，

上课的时候为什么不讲清楚呢现在还没讲晋中催芽呢，

什么时候讲，

按教学进度要到七月份，

怎么进种的时候讲收割，

收割的时候讲近种，

这不是脱离实际吗？

不行的应当马上改过来老陆，

教材有它自己的系统性怎么能随便改动呢不，

我看呐教材的系统性应当适应于生产的季节性，

龙校长说的对呀，

同学们，

这张大字报，

它说明了一个很重要的问题呀，

不批判资产阶级脱离实际的学风，

我们学校的教改是搞不好的，

林学系不讲江南的毛竹油茶杉树，

确切讲俄罗斯的白桦树，

农学系的土壤科为什么不可以讲一讲我们这里的红土壤，

天天讲欧洲的，

西伯利亚的黑土壤，

难道我们的老师都成了外国记者了吗啊，

为了改变这种状况，

我们要来一场教育革命的风暴，

五四运动，

革命青年敢打孔家店，

我们共大师生，

不但要打孔家店还要打资产阶级店，

简直是胡闹，

全乱套了这个学还怎么教下去，

我看你龙国正怎么个改法老龙啊，

昨天呐我从学校看完大字报回来想了整整一夜，

想出来个主意，

什么好主意啊来，

快说说吧，

好你们等一下，

你们看，

黄鹂呀好比是生产，

哄你好比是教学嗯，

现在呢，

你还能分的出来吗？

哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈，

就是要他分不出来老代表你是说我再给你打个比方吧，

你说我们这些种田人怎么学会种田的呢，

就是小时候大人讲一讲，

自己做一做，

做一做大人又讲一讲，

我看呐这就是你们大字报上说的那个教学结合生产哎对对，

这就是我的大字报，

这张大字报，

水平高啊两坨泥巴，

能说明什么？

教学上的三级四性才是真正的科学，

我们不能把教学问题简单化，

两坨泥巴，

是个简单的比喻，

但是它说明了一个理论与实践的辩证关系，

教学要结合生产就是这个道理，

我建议按照农林牧的生产季节改变课程我赞成，

我们共产主义劳动大学要自己闯出一条新路子，

这样吧我们不能从书本到书本从理论到理论，

而是要理论联系实际，

这个问题大家下去好好议论议论，

走吧，

孙主任你的思想通了吗？

对吧靠那两坨泥巴就能打到凯洛夫吗呵呵别提你的凯洛夫了我和他斗了好几个晚上，

瞧眼睛都熬红了，

我说老龙啊，

你心里到底是想办农场还是办大学啊，

办大学呀办大学，

世界上哪有这样的大学，

世界上没有，

我们就办他一所嘛就凭这两个泥巴，

你不要小看这两坨泥巴，

这绝不是我们坐在办公室里，

能想的出来的，

依我看，

这两坨泥巴，

比起我们目前的教学方法，

要高明的多呀哎，

老龙啊，

你可知道，

目前这一套这是多少年的传统多少中外教育家心血的结晶啊，

两坨泥巴能打倒他吗我说能打倒，

因为那一套是脱离生产脱离实际它是资产阶级的，

靠资产阶级，

二加二等于四，

是哪一个阶级的，

x加y，

又有什么阶级性，

只要我们能培养出，

有高度文化科学知识的人才来，

还不是为社会主义服务吗不对，

抽调了无产阶级政治单纯的追求高度的文化科学知识就会迷失方向，

把教学与生产劳动隔裂开来就一定会把教学引上邪路，

老曹，

毛主席说，

学问再多，

方向不对等于无，

不用了，

啊好多教室都没有人，

都到哪里去了到田里上课去了，

谁让他们去的，

把名字记下来批评记过，

同学们刚才给大家讲了道者和败者敬业的区别，

下面我讲一讲稻子和败子根部的区别，

张老师这些道题你一看就懂了我建议我们班应该向肖老师他们班学习把课堂搬到田里去，

给咱们讲讲科学种田合理密植同学们，

曹校长说这教学计划是专区政府专员批准的，

不能随便改动董校长，

同学们要求结合农时把课堂搬到田里去上嗯，

我去敲钟不，

我去找找曹校长再说，

谁让你们到田里去的肖老师让我们到田里去上课，

你看看你们这个样子，

啊还像个大学生呢，

以后不许打支交，

去吧哎呀老曹啊你这条规矩连我这个校长也不能进屋了，

哼，

老龙啊，

你为什么老把学生弄到田里去呢，

我找你就是要谈这个事儿，

现在是春耕大忙的时候，

我们的课堂应该结合农时搬到田里去，

这样才能让学生在学习和生产实践中，

更全面的掌握知识，

你说来说去还不是为了几粒谷子，

这可不是为了挤这骨子的事儿，

为什么你一定要把学生培养成眼光短浅胸无大志的人呢不对你的看法是错误的，

这是教育革命的大问题呀，

老曹，

你让同学们穿着鞋袜，

在课堂里植树在黑板上种田，

学农不务农学农不爱农，

这样培养出来的学生，

咱们能够赶上时代的步伐，

怎么能和全国人民同心同德的建设社会主义，

好好好你是书记你是校长你看怎么办就怎么办吧，

老曹老曹，

老头，

龙校长他，

敲钟，

各位快走啊，

哎呦咱们一会儿再来吧这个这个这个这个咱带带过去咱们一一去，

办公大，

开始我就不同意，

深山沟里办大学能培养出好人才，

现在既然办起来了就要按我们的样子办，

要，

正规化，

那些工农学生赶不上就让他们回家种地各尽所能嘛，

是啊可老龙他我们党内这样的同志不少，

他们的脑筋还停留在战争年代赶不上时代的潮流，

我们要和他们作斗争是要改造他们帮助他们赶上了，

老曹我说的对吧，

对呀赵副专员，

老龙这个人，

就是太固执了，

哼他固执我也有办法，

最近专区准备组织几个共大分校的负责人，

到全国各名牌院校去参观，

就叫龙国政带队，

钱秘书你跟他一块去好让他开开眼界，

它，

也会变的，

好赵副专员这个办法，

真是太好啦，

来大娘坐这儿吧，

到哪去啊，

看儿子啊在哪工作啊在大学读书读了几年了，

三年了，

乡亲们让我来看看他那这不，

核桃花生柚子干还有糯米果子都是大伙儿送的，

来快吃点儿吃点儿留着给儿子吃吧，

读的什么书啊这些都是外国的名家著作啊，

只有这样才能够一举成名天下知啊对对对，

你们看看人家农学院的条件多好啊，

同学少拔一点吧，

老大爷比起我们毕业论文来这几颗稻谷算得了什么啊，

唉真可惜呀，

孩子你怎么了，

又干又瘦还戴上了眼镜，

样子都变了，

乡亲们可惦记你呢让我来看看，

那这不都是乡亲们给的快吃点啊，

我还给你缝了套新衣裳，

快试试看合不合身儿妈快穿上让我看看呐，

妈你真是的这么难看的衣裳我怎么能穿的出去呢，

什么我一针一线的缝了几个晚上，

嫌难看，

孩子你在家的时候不也穿这样的衣裳吗可我现在是大学生，

孩子我还给你做了双布鞋，

妈你做这干什么？

太土气了，

拿回去吧，

嗯，

孩子这书咱不能念了走跟我回家，

妈你怎么了你临来的时候不是跟乡亲们说过吗要回去改变家乡的山山水水呀妈我现在是有知识的人了，

怎么能回到那小山沟里去呢，

你变了，

妈你先坐一会儿我要去听欧阳教授讲课了，

不能迟到啊，

同志啊，

好好的一个孩子怎么会变成这个样啊，

这让我回去，

怎么跟乡亲们说呀，

大娘，

别难过，

我送你回去，

工农的年轻一代，

在这样的学校里，

与其说是受教育倒不如说是受资产阶级的奴化，

与其说是受教育，

倒不如说是受资产阶级，

同志哦是老龙啊哎呀唐宁同志太巧了从哪来，

参观农林院校去了，

有收获吧，

有啊你好像有什么心事，

我一夜都没有睡着啊，

有一个问题，

在我心里像火一样的燃烧，

唐宁同志，

我一直在想，

我们党自己办的农业大学，

为什么还办在大城市里，

远离农村脱离三大革命斗争的实践，

为什么？

教育大权至今还把持在那些资产阶级老爷的手里，

他们顽固的，

推行着一条，

修正主义的教育路线，

你说的对，

这件大事不解决我们无产阶级的革命事业谁来接班呢，

老龙这是一场复杂严重的斗争，

要有开顶峰船的勇气，

我们共产主义劳动大学，

要坚定的沿着毛主席指引的航向走，

老大表老大表，

媳妇北坡稻田也发现虫害你看这是后山的虫情很严重，

这南坡的这是挖地道，

大队的田里都发现了虫子，

这种虫子啊咱们山区很少见，

老代表，

我们在学校研究过水稻的各种虫害这叫叶强盗，

这种虫子一夜之间能把全大队的庄稼都吃掉，

这么厉害是啊这种虫子白天躲起来晚上跑出来咬庄家今天晚上我们必须立即采取措施把它消灭，

金凤今天队里大部分劳动力都进城用化肥去了，

这么巧这可怎么办，

这样吧我从小路赶回学校请示领导发动全体同学来灭虫，

金凤我跟你去我们也去不时间很紧迫你们先做好灭虫的准备，

同学们对明天的考试有些紧张，

通过这次测验，

我要刷掉一些不合格的学生，

把学校好好整顿整顿，

建立一套正规化的秩序，

这是谁的位置李金凤的，

他上哪儿去了到身边大队帮助检查虫情去了哦，

他知道不知道明天考试知道，

知道考试还都，

简直是胡闹，

孙主任把这件事记下来以后处理好，

同学们，

这不是一次普通的考试，

这是专区统一布置下来的，

它关系到每个同学的前途问题，

啊大家要争取最高分数要考出水平来，

曹校长孙主任，

哦好了好了，

李金凤快坐下来抓紧时间复习功课，

曹校长身边大队的田里发现了大面积的虫害情况很严重，

干什么干什么干什么？

大惊小怪的，

有虫人家生产队不会去灭，

哼多管闲事，

曹校长我就是为了这件事跑回来的，

今天身边大队的社员都挑化肥去了队长也不在家，

请领导动员全体同学马上出发去灭虫吧你说什么？

明天就要考试你让同学们去列图，

你这不是胡闹，

曹校长，

你看重情这么严重，

我们供大师生能眼睁睁的看着不管吗？

李金凤，

你现在不是普通农民，

你是一个大学生，

金凤姐，

童鞋们，

我们读书是为了什么？

难道是为了考试为了分数吗？

在我们农村，

就连小孩儿，

看见掉了几粒谷子也会捡起来交给生产队，

我们怎么能够只管埋头读书赶考试争分数，

不把在学校学到的科学知识去为农业服务，

却让虫害，

吃掉贫下中农的血汗呐金凤姐，

我跟你一块去灭虫，

我们也去，

我给你一份，

我们畜牧系也去我们农机系都来了我们也来了，

同学们走，

app在三磷酸腺苷酶的作用下，

左右，

转化为abt加h三bo，

哎牛仔你们到哪儿去啊到山边大队灭虫去走啊哎呀我还有条公式没背熟呢那随你的便吧，

哎牛仔等等我，

就等你，

大爷不要走，

跟他们顶这样对待我们，

受不了，

小妹把这些还给学校，

菊花姐我不让你走吗？

小妹放开我叫爸爸爸龙校长怎么还不回来，

怎么？

要走就走吗？

同学们，

我们一定要等龙校长回来，

我们工农同学，

进学校不容易，

让我们离开学校，

也没那么容易，

金凤姐说的对就不走就不走就不走，

那曹校长能同意吗？

小妹爸爸，

我跟你说谁修的路谁开的荒，

谁救得了谁是他们，

是他们这些皮下肉肉的同学，

就连这些桌椅板凳，

都是他们辛辛苦苦做出来的，

他流血流汗，

大学校建起来了，

一句话都不敢出校门，

我想不通好啦好啦你懂什么？

就懂在旧社会地主资本家才这么做小妹，

你胡说些什么？

就是就是，

于刚我问你你是党委委员还老说要猛烈开炮你你就不能轰他几炮吗？

空了可他说是贯彻上级的意图龙校长回来喽，

怎么了啊，

出什么事了，

你们为什么都不说话呀，

啊卢校长，

你可回来了于刚，

到底出什么事了，

你看，

鬼学，

你们犯了什么错误没来得及参加考试，

曹校长说我们交了白卷，

鱼缸，

这件事，

党委是怎么研究的党委根本没研究，

曹校长说这是上级的意图教务处有权决定，

什么这么大的事，

不通过党委，

龙校长，

这是江大年的草帽，

他上哪去了，

背着行李走了，

走多久了刚走，

天大年，

江大年，

煎大米，

卢校长到你，

走跟我回去，

上大学，

请看这就是他们的白圈，

这个决定，

我请示了专区政府专员，

你们搞突然袭击，

考试的时候李金凤他们在哪，

在皮下种农的田里，

这些白卷能说明什么问题不，

这些白卷很说明问题，

在这些白卷里面，

有高度的政治觉悟，

有深厚的无产阶级感情，

有同学们的汗水有贫下中农的几万斤粮食，

同学们做得好，

做的对对，

对在哪里，

我们这不是农场，

不是生产队，

同志我们这是大学，

既然叫大学嘛，

那就应该有一个统一的标准办学校，

无产阶级和资产阶级从来就没有统一的标准，

就拿这十五名同学来说吧，

按照我们的标准这些同学是好学生，

按着你们的标准却把他们赶出校门，

这又怎么能够统一呢，

什么统一的标准，

说穿了就是你们借考试为名把教育革命中敢于斗争的好同学排挤出去，

难道这不是对工农同学的迫害吗？

你你这是污蔑这些都是事实，

解放前，

是谁打击迫害公众，

是地主资产阶级，

今天你也这样做，

你站在什么立场上，

你代表了谁的利益，

你正是代表了被打倒的地主资产阶级的利益我代表资产阶级的利益，

哼别忘了，

我也是在抗日烽火中参加革命的，

老实说我祖宗三代都是搞教育的，

论办教育我比你更有发言权，

听说你这位大学校长，

还是在延安好的忙吧，

哼太不像话什么态度摆什么老资格，

我是和他不一样，

他是把文化当作资本，

来到革命队伍的，

我是带着地主老财的边痕，

参加革命的，

我这个放牛娃，

是到了延安才扫的盲，

没有毛主席，

没有共产党就没有我，

同志们党委会，

继续进行，

我让你背的那些原理，

背的怎么样了基本上背会了不，

基本原理要背的滚瓜烂熟哎，

诶这把手术刀，

我们贫下中农就是要保他们，

龙校长，

这样做，

到底是为哪一个阶级办学，

我们已经改正了错误，

今天校单位开会，

孙主任呐我们贫下中农打心眼儿的感激你们呐，

你们教出来的学生就是好啊，

这样的学校我举双手赞成，

老龙啊，

过去有些年轻人，

念了几年书，

就忘记了家乡，

草鞋一脱换上了皮鞋，

就在，

不回来了嗯说得好啊，

照这样下去，

那谁来建设咱这社会主义的新山区呀，

孙主任你说是不是，

老代表你坐我给你倒杯水呃不了不了乡亲们呐还在等着我的回信儿呢，

哈哈哈哈哈好好好我走了啊，

哎你们谈你们谈吧啊哈哈哈哈哈，

老代表的话，

值得深思啊，

我们到底为哪个阶级办学，

捣碎，

教学，

不按照毛泽东思想教人，

危险呐，

老师们同学们我们共大要成为无产阶级专政的工具，

我们学校是农业大学设来设去我们不但要掌握科学文化知识，

还要把学校的小课堂搬到农村的大课堂里去，

拜贫下中农为师，

做到学用结合上生产斗争课上阶级斗争的主课，

星星的那些，

教教育革命起东风起东风半工半读勤工俭学，

危险呐，

是啊过去，

我一直认为，

只要尽我的所能，

把知识传授给学生，

他们就会自然的为社会主义服务，

真没有想到会发生今天这样的事情，

这对我来说是一次沉痛的教训，

过去你多次对我进行帮助可是我听不进去呀，

六个小章，

现在我愿意向党委，

做深刻的检查，

孙主任现在认识，

也不晚呐，

让我们一起，

把更大的教育革命，

搞好龙校长，

龙校长，

什么事工作组前秘书在山边大队观察三四一包试点工作李金凤跟他们斗争的很激烈，

说今天下午还开大会，

赵副专员的报告讲的很清楚嘛，

三子一包的好处就是充分调动每家，

每户每个人的积极性嘛，

啊让我们大家都过富裕的好日子嘛，

我们要把土地，

农具，

牲口都分给你们，

多劳多得，

超产归你们自己，

三子一报就是让我们分田单干走回头路，

这样下去那不是跟旧社会一样，

富的更富穷的更穷了，

这是让我们吃二遍苦再受二茬罪，

对我们绝不能同意，

造福专员的报告是走资本主义道路的，

岂有此理啊这就是龙国政的得意门生把他压起来诶，

钱秘书，

你很忙啊，

龙校长你们学校办的很有成绩呀培养的尽是调皮捣蛋的学生到处拆我们工作组的台，

李金凤，

他犯了什么错误，

什么错误，

错误大的很，

他居然敢在群众大会上公开反对三支一包，

还有呢，

你看看他说赵府庄园的报告是大毒草，

还有呢，

他煽动群众反对工作组，

还有呢这就够了，

我们今天晚上要开个大会批判李金凤，

小妹小妹，

给什么我给你弄来的上大学的建设信机会难得快离开工大，

回去收拾一下，

看乱糟糟的爸爸这怎么能行呢什么行不行的，

我革命几十年套一张优待卷还不应该吗？

爸爸请大家坐下来坐下来，

现在开会，

社员同志们，

今天，

我们开个批判大会，

批判供大学生李金凤，

安静一点，

安静一点，

因为李金凤，

反对我们工作组，

破坏三子一包的政策，

特别是，

他反对政府专员，

反对赵副专员就是反对专区，

反对专区就是反党，

这就是反党的警察什么反正政府专员就是反党啊，

现在先由李金凤进行检查，

然后大家再来揭发批判我先检查啊，

这就是龙校长哦他就是龙校长，

社员同志们，

要说检查，

我得先检查，

因为我是共大嵩山分校党委书记兼校长，

要说我们有缺点错误的话，

那就是在那股资本主义逆流的影响下，

我们有个别学生，

经不住考验，

自动退了学，

哎你要干什么哎可是现在哎老龙你别扯远了好，

我现在就说李金凤，

他是坏学生，

还是好学生，

这要看他的表现，

它的罪状，

是反对三字一包，

可是三子一包是什么货色呢，

这个问题，

贫下中农最清楚，

他是要我们倒退是走资本主义道路的货色什么？

你再说一遍，

三字一包，

是走资本主义道路的货色，

好好，

李金凤反对倒退反对走资本主义道路，

积极搞社会主义，

我们能说他是坏学生吗李新凤是好学生，

的确是好学生一定会是好学生，

我也是工大分校的负责人，

我声明一句，

刚才他的话，

不代表我的意见，

李金富，

反对专区反对工作组反对赵副专员的报告，

他把自己放在党的队里面上去了，

啊这样的学生怎么能说是好学生呢，

啊这个坏学生嘛，

对对对李金凤是坏学生哎李金凤，

李金凤他不是反对党，

他是反对内线，

自称为共产党员而实质上是资产阶级民主化，

他不是反对专区，

而是反对专区里面，

那些主张走资本主义道路的当权人物，

他这样做，

正是热爱党，

维护党的利益，

说明它有高度的党性，

它使我们更大，

最好的学生，

李金凤，

李金凤就是坏学生嘛，

既然你们说他是坏学生，

那就让他上台来，

有贫下中农给我们工大的学生做个鉴定吗？

说吧孩子，

你说，

你们可以把我关起来，

你们可以不给我饭吃，

但是让我检讨办不到，

我没有错，

我是一个学生，

一个普通的党员，

我说不出多少道理，

但是毛主席有一句话我永远也不会忘记，

这句话就是，

只有社会主义，

能够救中国，

你做的对，

顶得好，

这才是我们贫下中农的贴心人呐，

是啊妈妈妈妈，

老曹咱们走，

走吧龙国政，

你等着我也要讲话，

小妹还没走，

小妹说吧，

这是我爸爸给我弄来的上大学的介绍信，

他要我离开农村，

离开工大，

到所谓的名牌大学去读书，

爸爸我要当着大家的面回答你我不跟你走，

龙校长和贫下中农对我的教育，

是我看到的前途，

看到了希望，

我热爱工大，

我绝不离开工大，

是的我今天心里很难过，

很多做父母的，

都希望自己的儿女能够继承革命的传统，

可是我这个革命多年的爸爸，

去给我留下了这张介绍信，

不我要听毛主席的话，

在农村干一辈子革命，

喂你做的对我们天下众众欢迎你呀小妹，

校长董校长，

老根你，

我们校长我，

我错了，

这都是我爹，

让我干，

从今天起，

我要跟着党走，

龙校长，

我不能离开供大呀，

于发根，

共大欢迎你呀，

社员同志们，

同学们，

这个批判会开的好啊，

他有力的批判了复辟倒退的错误路线，

我们共大的全体师生，

永远和贫下中农站在一起，

在阶级斗争，

路线斗争的风浪中，

锻炼成长，

我们办这样的大学不是搬起石头砸自己的脚吗？

龙国政同志，

你辜负了党对你的信任，

你煽动学生竟反到我的头上来了这是党纪所不允许的龙国政同志，

你现在悬崖勒马还来得及呀啊，

老龙啊，

这是领导上，

给你最后改正错误的机会，

如果不改我就开除你的党籍撤销你的职务，

哼你们利用党，

和人民给你们的权利，

开除我的党籍，

撤销我的职务，

你们是做得出来的，

但是并不说明你们正确你们有道理，

真理，

不在你们手上，

你们这些做法，

使我又一次坚信，

共产主义劳动大学，

办得好，

办得对，

你那个工大好什么对什么人家说工大是农场是劳动大队是四不像，

我们供大，

是按照毛主席的革命教育路线办起来的，

是以共产主义精神共产主义道德品质共产主义劳动态度培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，

有什么不好啊，

敌人恨我们骂我们，

这并不奇怪，

因为他们是敌人，

奇怪的是你们竟和敌人唱一个调子，

真是狂妄到极点，

太固执了哼，

给我立即撤掉这所学校，

校党委认为这个撤销我们分校的决定是错误的，

他不符合毛泽东思想，

不符合党的教育方针，

我们坚信共大的道路是完全正确的，

我们要和资产阶级教育路线，

坚决斗争到底，

同志们校党委决定，

我们要向党中央毛主席汇报，

唐宁同志你看，

这件事情我知道，

这个决定是错误的，

同志们，

告诉大家一个特大的喜讯，

七月三十日，

伟大领袖毛主席给我们共产主义劳动大学写了一封信，

毛主席高度赞扬我们公道，

肯定了我们的大方向，

伟大领袖毛主席说，

同志们，

你们的事业我是完全赞成的，

同志们，

毛主席光辉的七三零指示是我们胜利的旗帜前进的方向，

在教育革命的征途上，

是不会风平浪静的斗争并没有结束，

为了巩固无产阶级专政我们要和传统的所有制关系和传统观念实行最彻底的决裂，
