It's very important in philosophy to

make sure that we define our words and

our terms to make sure that `the meanings

that we intend by them` are in fact what

are being received by those that we are

`engaged` in conversation with and it so

happens that there are several terms and

words and philosophy that aren't unique

to philosophy but they're used in

philosophy in `a very kind of` specific

way and we need to make sure and remind

ourselves how we're using those within

philosophy to avoid those kinds of

confusions let's begin with the terms

metaphysics and `epistemology` now these

happen to be two words that are they're

used outside of philosophy but they are

pretty specific to philosophy

metaphysics meaning technically after

physics because Aristotle `coined this

phrase` when he wrote a book on physics

and then he decided to write on the

things that go beyond physics or it

comes after physics so he wrote

metaphysics but we use that term to

refer to talking about the nature of

reality how things exist how things

exist external to us meaning external to

our thoughts out there in the physical

world how do things exist so we might

even ask how does justice exist or we

may ask something more `mundane` how does

a bike exist so if we're talking about

how does a bike exist you know does it

exist as an `assemblage` of parts is is

that what it really is

wheels spokes brakes seats bars etc or

does it actually exist on a atomic level

is that how the bike really exists

atomically or does it only exist as a

bike when assembled as a whole unit okay

so this is a metaphysical discussion

really because we're just discussing how

does a bike for instance exist now in

epistemology we would be asking how do

we know FB stay to know epistemology

theory of how we know anything in the

process of coming to know things so I

might tell you you know you're from the

planet Zoron and you wanna you're

pointing at a bike saying what is this

well I might give you an explanation and

the alien might say well how do you know

this how do you know this is true how

did you get the information and process

it so that what you're telling me can be

somehow verified so epistemology is sort

of the whole discussion about how we

know things and how we can be certain

that what we know is true

that's an epistemological discussion all

right so let's move on

we've got objective and subjective now

you use these all the time but let's

just kind of go over it again let's

remind ourselves that objective means

the things that are external to us the

object out there

whereas subjective sub under beneath

internal those are the things that are

going on inside us now let's let's take

for instance we're talking about a candy

bar and I ask you what is your favorite

candy bar well you you could point to a

candy bar external to you and say this

one right here is my favorite candy bar

but if I say to you what is your

favorite flavor and you say chocolate

now that is a subjective opinion that is

within you

we can never say that chocolate is

objectively the favorite flavor it's not

for everyone that's a subjective it's a

matter of subjective opinion it's within

you it's internal and that's winging by

subjective matters as opposed to that

which is objective or external to us an

important distinction to keep in mind in

philosophy anyway well okay let's move

on

how about perceiving conceive perceive

the word perceive in philosophy is

linked to sensation and experience when

you have a perception you are using your

five senses to bring in information into

your mind you're using the sensation

created by your sensory organs your five

sensory organs

- that give you an experience you bring

them in so that then you can what well

you can think about them and have

thoughts about them you can conceive

them in a sense now because you can

perceive something doesn't necessarily

equate to conceive and vice-versa for

instance if I say look at the look at

the ball hanging from the ceiling in the

dance hall it's got many sides it's got

mirrors they shine light on it spins

around puts dots on the wall and I tell

you this is called a chilli agon why

because the chilli gone is a 1000 sided

object so in fact it may be a chilli

gone but if you look at one of these

balls you're not going to be able to say

oh yes that

is a chilly argon I can perceive all

1000 sides and therefore I understand it

is a Chilean you're not going to be able

to perceive it however you have no

problem conceiving I can tell you that a

chilly gon has 1000 sides and then I can

point to the ball in the ceiling and say

and that has 1000 sides therefore it's a

Chile gone and with thought and reason

you can understand that even though you

can't necessarily perceive it ok now

another couple of words worth looking at

our reason and emotion now these are

very common words right let's remind

ourselves that reason has to do with

mental activity rationality we equate

with the word reason whereas emotion is

linked to the physical and the passions

as a word the passions meaning the

feelings that we get internally as a

result of information given to subdue us

through our five senses these are the

passions emotions happen to you reason

is an activity that we do more

volitionally by choice emotions tend

like I said happen to happen to you so

when you feel emotionally I'm a little

I'm a little edgy because I'm hungry

you see that's something that happens to

you you don't decide I think I'm going

to begin to be hungry I'm going to do

that now you have to these emotions

happen to you they well up from within

whereas mental activity technically can

be diverted divorced from emotion and

can take place without being linked

necessarily to the five senses they are

of course linked and some of the things

we think about can

make us emotional some of the emotional

experiences that we have can affect the

way we think but there are two in

philosophy we want to make sure that we

we distinguish between the two

experiences that we have when we talk

about reason and emotion great let's see

then there's general in particular this

is just a simple distinction remember

general genus principles the general

category of something as opposed to the

particulars in that category the

specifics the specific examples of

something in the category so if we're

talking about dogs you've got the

general principle the general category

of canine or dog whereas within that

general category there are particulars

there are poodles and Great Danes and

whatnot those are specific examples of

dog but they themselves do not contain

all of the general principle so again

general in philosophy we want to

remember especially the term principle

when we talk about principles we're

talking about general statements or

ideas under which many examples might

exist okay and then we have the branches

of philosophy rationalism and empiricism

which are defined in another video but

just real quickly in rationalism where

we're thinking about theory we're

thinking about concepts and ideas using

reason and a good way to little phrase

to link with rationalism is simply think

about it when we when we pause and we

begin to reflect upon

maybe our experiences we're thinking and

we're trying to be rational and use our

reason to think about these things

whereas empiricism from the word impure

i2c means that we're using our five

senses to bring into us experiences that

we then maybe in turn will think about

so a good phrase to link with empiricism

is look and see so if again you are from

another planet and I'm explaining to you

what a bike is I'd give you the theory

about a bike you know it's a it's a

little contraption with a with steering

mechanism and wheels and a place to seat

and a way to pedal yourself so that you

can move about okay great

look we've thought about that we've got

the idea the theory we rationally

understand it now let's experience it

and so now we point to a bike and we say

look see that that's what I'm talking

about that's what the theory is that now

you can look at this and have the

experience you can even get on the bike

and have the experience of the theory so

that's a quick overview of those two

terms that come up a lot in philosophy

and finally we have contingent and

dependent these are actually related

contingent meaning dependent probably

the easiest way to explain these terms

is or at least the term contingent is to

think about how you are contingent upon

their having been parents that conceived

you we know this is a fact by your very

existence your existence proves that at

one time there were parents that

conceived you

okay so we're going to look at key

philosophical terms today

these are kind of the things that you'll

use throughout

the course and they really are ones that

you need to know

so i thought we'd just do one quick

tutorial on it

and we'll just go through all of the

kind of central philosophical terms

so let's just begin the first one is

what we call a proposition

which is basically just a fancy word for

a statement

uh it's a statement so

something that is put into words

wow we are being precise today it's a

statement

that makes a claim so

i make lots of statements that make a

claim uh

this is an example of one

something like let me uh let her put up

a box for examples

uh that

is a car is is an example right

um it's not a particularly interesting

example but it's an example

of a proposition making a claim a fact

claim

whereas i like a car it's something

slightly different right

now there are kind of two

types of statement there are synthetic

statements and analytics statements

two types of proposition

so let's start with a synthetic

statement now full warning

i'm about to tell you a sentence and

it's gonna seem complicated but i

promise in like a minute

it's not going to seem complicated

anymore

so i'm going to write it out okay

it's the the sentence let's start with

the sentence

the sentence is where the predicate

isn't found in the subject

now if you're anything like me

when you started studying philosophy you

had no idea

what predicate uh and subject

are so the predicate is

something that is about the subject

and the subject

is the thing that the sentence is about

so that probably didn't help you very

much let me give you an example

okay so something like this would be a

synthetic

claim um all bold

men are

cold sorry about the pause

i was just trying to think of a

non-insulting thing okay

so there are two things going on here

here

this bit this is the subject

boldness or bold men perhaps is the

subject

here this is the

predicate

okay so that's the thing that is about

the subject you see that one

is about that one but

these this is not drawn

from that there is a clear kind of

distinction there in in uh

in type so the

the we don't know for instance

that all bold men are cold they might

for instance wear a hat

what we'd need to do is go out and study

and have a look

the opposite to this is what we call an

analytics statement

this is where

the uh the the predicate

have you guessed it if it's the opposite

the predicate

is found

in the subject

this is uh what david hume called um

so david hume was an enlightenment

philosopher

um from scotland um uh a great life

story

haven't got time to tell you now uh but

uh analytics statements what david hume

called

um uh kind of playing with ideas

uh whereas synthetic statements are

matters of fact so this is an example of

a synthetic statement

let me give you an example of an

analytic statement

so you're going to find out how useless

these are in about two seconds all

bold men are

well let's do this bit together this

remember

i don't highlight the whole thing this

time this is the subject

and because it is an analytic statement

where the

predicate is drawn from the subject as

opposed to here

with a predicate isn't drawn from the

subject

well we want to say with an analytic

statement that

all blog men are something drawn from

here maybe

wrong color apologies maybe hairless

um would be an example of something

where

very much it's drawn from the subject

so this is the predicate again remember

and in an in a in an analytic statement

the subject

directly influences the predicate we can

know this

in a very particular way let's move on

to how we can know these things

there are kind of two ways that you can

know things in philosophy

a priori and a posteriori

so an a priori kind of reasoning is

through reason alone through through

logic

or it might be what we call innate

innate means kind of

already in your mind and

analytic statements here are a really

good example

of a priori reasoning

okay all bald men are bold or hairless i

don't actually need to meet

a bold person to know that all bald

people bomb men are headless right

i kind of know that already a posteriori

on the other hand

is through experience

so this is where we

go out and experience the world and

gathered data

now a lot of people empiricists

think that matters of fact so these

synthetic statements like hume we

mentioned a minute ago as an empiricist

they think that synthetic statements

propositions can only be known

a posteriori but some rationalists they

think that some

synthetic statements like that can be

known a priori although maybe not that

one

okay so that's synthetic where

the subject is drawn from the

predicate just ignore me for a minute

whilst i uh

spend a while getting rid of all of the

text um

that's where the subject to a synthetic

statement is where the subject the

predicate

isn't found in the subject an analytics

statement

is where the so the

predicate is found in the subject

so a synthetic statement where the

predicate isn't found in the subject an

analytic statement where the predicate

is found in the subject

and we can know these propositions

through a priori reasoning so

just in our minds alone or we can know

them a posteriori through experiences

through

our senses but in order to claim that we

know

something we need to form it into an

argument

an argument is a very particular kind of

thing it's not

what you have with your friend when you

disagree about something

and you get really heated and upset

it's instead an attempt

to prove something

so to prove a proposition

in this case through reason

so it's through the use of logic

now they're very particular kinds of

things

an argument if the logic is

valid and the premises will get to a

premise and a second a premise

by the way it's just a a step in an

argument

if the premise is true

then so if the logic works

so if the logic works and the premises

are true a premise is just a step in an

argument

uh then the argument is what we call

sound uh

that is we have to accept it as true

so let me give you an example of what an

argument looks like

a classical form of an argument is what

we call a syllogism

a syllogism might be something along

these lines

say premise one

and then premise two

remember premises are just steps they're

propositions that could be synthetic or

analytic

and they tie together to form a

conclusion

for our purposes premises are very

useful

uh syllogism was very useful first noted

by aristotle

let me give you an example it could be

something like this

all uh

say all men

here's a here's a man

ah mortal

um so so that

i don't know why i laughed that i was

with sinister

uh let's draw a grave shall we all men

are mortal

in other words all men will die

one day uh apologies if they got the

colors wrong there so all men are mortal

and then premise two might be something

like this

it might be well

this guy aerosols example is socrates so

let's give him a

bit of a beard tufty hair over here

socrates

is a

there's a man he's an example of a man

and the conclusion therefore

is of course that socrates

and it's pretty simple socrates is of

course mortal

now albert camus put it like this once

he said

a very simple syllogism until you

replace socrates with yourself

um but

that's that's the basic idea what we've

got here

is we've got two premises that form

together

to make a conclusion so it's premise one

plus premise two equals the conclusion

and that is how you get here premise one

all men immortal

premise two socrates is a man conclusion

therefore socrates is mortal

now notice how we're building up here we

might we might say that this

all men immortal is known a priori it's

a

it's kind of a an analytic statement

right because it's inherent in the

concept of man that he's mortal

you might say that um is it we could

hypoth

hypothetically say there aren't all um

mortal men um then maybe you could

imagine a non-water one so maybe you do

need a posteriori knowledge to know that

is a man well you definitely need a

posteriorized synthetic

that's a synthetic premise right because

it's not inherent here

so also we need to know

that he is we need to experience it or

at least read about people who have met

him

and then the conclusion is drawn from

those two premises

i want to very quickly at the end just

talk about types of argument

a deductive argument is this

a deductive argument is

where the

premises

mean the conclusion must be true

now that means that it

can't be false uh if the premises are

true and the logic

is right then the conclusion has to be

accepted

even if we don't like it and that's one

of the joys of philosophy is that

we accept these things these are

remember i said before

these arguments are not like the

arguments you have with your friends i

remember

my my first teacher in philosophy

telling me that in a philosophical

argument

there are no such things as losers there

are just people who win and people who

learn

something okay the other kind of

argument is an inductive argument

an inductive argument is

kind of where a set of evidence

so this might be oh that's uh that s is

in the wrong place

that might be uh experience especially

which is

a posteriori well done uh

suggests a conclusion

in other words it's probable

a probable uh conclusion rather than

definitely true now that's really

important because that is actually how

we gain

most of our knowledge science is a

really good example

of that so we can pull all of these

different things together to give us

very complicated

uh sentences this synthetic synthetic

april this synthetic a posterior alright

uh premise uh leads to the added to this

premise leads to this conclusion this is

a deductive or inductive argument

we start building up philosophical

terminology which will help us

both in writing essays and in reading

about philosophy
