#### Technologies of the self: A Seminar with Michel Foucault. 手动打字可能有误
Q: Why did you come to the University of Vermont ?

A: I came to try to explain more precisely to some people what kind of work i’am doing, to know what kind of work they are doing, and to establish some permanent relationships. I am not a writer, a philosopher, a great figure of intellectual life: i am a teacher. There is a social phenomenon that `troubles me a great deal`: Since the 1960s, some teachers are becoming public men with the same obligations. I don't want to becaome a prohet and say, "Please sit down, what i have to say is very important." I have come to discuss our common work.

Q: You are most frequently termed "philosopher" but also "historian", "structualist", and "Marxist".
The title of your chair at the College de France is "Professor of the History of Systems of Thought".
What does this mean ?

A: I don't feel that it is nessary to know exactly what i am. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning. If you knew what you began a book what you would say at the end, do you think that you would have the courage to write it ? What is true for writing and for a love relationship is true also for life. The game is worthwhile insofar as we don't know what will be the end. My field is the history of thought. Man is a thinking being. The way he think is related to society, politics. economics, and history and is also related to very general and universal categories and formal structures. But thought is something other than societal relations. The way people really think is not adequately analyzed by the univeral categories of logic. Between social history and formal analyses of thought there is a path, a lane - maybe very narrow - which is the path of the historian of thought.


Q: In the History of Sexuality, you refer to the person who "upsets established laws and somehow anticipates the coming freedom." Do you see your own work in this light ?

A: No. For rather a long period, people have asked me to tell them what will happpen and to give them a program for the future. We know very well that, even with the best intentions, those programs become a tool, an instrument of oppression. Rousseau, a lover of freedom, was used in the French Revolution to build up a model of social oppression. Marx would be horrified by Stalinism and Leninism. My role - and that is too emphatic a word - is to show people that they are much freer than they feel, that people accept as truth, as evidence, some themes which have been built up at a certain moment during history, and that this so-called evidence can be criticized and destoryed. To change something in the minds of people - that's the role of an intellectual.
