PAMELA SAENGER: Hi, everyone.

My name is Pamela Saenger
Thank you for coming to

today's Authors at Google
presentation.

I'd like to introduce Peter
Hessler over here, the Beijing

correspondent for the New Yorker
here to discuss his new

book Oracle Bones: A Journey
Between China and the West.

You'll notice you copies
of River Town: Two

Years on the Yangtze.

Consider that a sort of
teaser to whet your

appetite for his new book.

A native of Columbia, Missouri,
Peter studied

English literature at Princeton
and Oxford before

going to China as a Peace
Corps volunteer in 1996.

His two-year experience of
teaching English in Fuling a

town on the Yangtze inspired
river town, his critically

acclaimed first book.

After finishing his Peace Corps
stint Hessler wrote

freelance pieces for Atlantic
Monthly and the New York Times

before returning to
China 1999 as a

Beijing-based freelance writer.

There he wrote for publications
including the

Asian Wall Street Journal, the
Boston Globe, and the South

China Morning Post before moving
onto magazine work for

the National Geographic
and the New Yorker.

In 2001, New Yorker named him
the first full-time resident

correspondent in the
People's Republic.

His writings have also appeared
in the New York

Times, the Philadelphia
Inquirer, the Washington Post,

the Newark Star-Ledger, and
National Geographic.

Peter Hessler's magazine stories
have been selected for

the Best American Travel Writing
anthologies of 2001,

2004, and 2005, and also for
the Best American Sports

Writing anthology of 2004.

He currently lives in Beijing.

Welcome Peter.

Thank you for joining us.



PETER HESSLER: Thank you.

It's my pleasure to be here.

As Pamela explained, the book
that you were given is River

Town which is my first book, and
I'm going to talk a little

bit about actually my
second book which is

called Oracle Bones.

But there is a definite link
between the two, and I'm going

to talk about one particular
strain that

sort of connects them.

I first went to live in China in
1996 with the Peace Corps.

I was a Peace Corps volunteer in
a small city called Fuling

which was on the Yangtze
River of quite a

remote part of China.

It was a town that did not have
other foreign residents

apart from me and one other
Peace Corps volunteer.

And before we arrived there
had not been any Americans

there for about half
a century.

And we were sent there
to teach English

at a teachers college.

In China one of the major
educational endeavors is the

study of English.

It's become compulsory in
Chinese schools from sixth

grade on, and to try to meet the
demand for teachers there

is an intensive effort at
training young people.

And that was part of
what we were doing.

So the students that we taught
were college students, and

they were majoring in English.

When I taught them they
were seniors.

And their intended job was to
finish studying English and

then eventually go back to
their hometowns and home

villages and become a middle
school teachers of English.

Most of these people that
I taught were from the

countryside in China.

Most of them were from very poor
backgrounds, and often

the generation gap between them
and their parents was

remarkable.

I had students whose
grandparents, grandmothers,

had had bound feet.

A number of my students had
parents who were illiterate.

But these were young
people who were now

becoming college educated.

So, in a sense, they
were a transitional

generation in China.

They had been born around the
time Mao Zedong died in 1976.

Most of them were 1975,
1976 birthdays.

So really, in a very literal
sense, they had grown up with

China's changes, and that gave
them a unique perspective on

the new China that has come
about since reform

and opening in 1978.

Studying English had often
been an abstract

endeavor for them.

Many of them had studied for
five or six years before they

ever saw a foreigner much less
had a conversation in English.

And, at some point, they had all
given themselves English

names because usually people in
China do this when they're

studying English.

And because English was still
abstract, these names were

sort of hit or miss.

I had some students who
had named themselves

after famous people.

So I had a student who had named
herself Barbara after

Barbara Bush.

I had a student who
had named himself

Armstrong after the Astronaut.

Another young woman had named
herself Keller after Helen

Keller who is a heroine
to many young Chinese.

Other names were more
mysterious.

I had a student who called
himself Silence Hill.

I had another student who
called himself Yellow.

There was a very small boy named
Pen, and there was a

very pretty girl
named Coconut.

And there was one boy, a very
tall boy, who always wore

military uniform, full
camouflage dress, who had

named himself Daisy.



I was never able to get a clear
sense on why he had come

up with the name Daisy.

The dean actually asked me about
it at one point, but I

liked the idea of having a
mysterious student with the

name Daisy in full camouflage
in the back of my class, and

so I never encouraged him
to change his name.

After graduation I taught there
for two years, and after

graduation most of the students
became teachers

themselves.

And actually a lot of them
are now teaching in the

countryside in Sichuan And I
kept in touch with them.

I send letters to more than
100 of them twice a year.

And so I've learned
about their lives

since leaving the college.

And, of course, many of them
teach young students and they

give them English names often,
and often they name them after

their classmates.

So now you have sort of second
generation Coconuts, and

Daisies, and Pens.

There was one student who
had named himself DJ.

Again, I had no idea where
that came from.

But DJ called me once when I
was in Beijing after I had

moved back to China.

And he said, Mr. Hessler, I want
you to know that I gave

my students English names, and
I named one student Peter and

one student Adam.

Now Adam was the other Peace
Corps volunteer who taught

with me in Fuling.

And I was very touched, and
I said, oh, thank you DJ.

That's very nice of you.

And he said, actually the
student named Peter is

probably the dumbest student
in the class.

And periodically he would keep
me updated on how poorly Peter

was studying when I
was in Beijing.

I want to talk today a little
bit about one student in

particular who I've kept
in touch with.

The new book Oracle Bones
follows a number of strands

through modern China including
some historical stories, but

it also follows two of
my former students.

I want to talk about
one of them.

His English name, when
I first began to

teach him, was Willie.

And Willie is the kind of kid
that I think every teacher has

no matter where he or
she is working, but

particularly in China.

First of all he was from
a very poor background.

Neither of Willie's parents
could read or write.

Actually his father had
never even attended

school for one day.

He'd grown up on a very small
farm, and neither of his

brothers went beyond
elementary school.

And somehow this kid
had made it out, he

had tested into college.

And he had a gift for English.

He was obsessed with
the language.

He studied it constantly.

He would listen to Voice of
America, listen to the BBC.

He would read anything he could
get his hands on, and

collected words.

He was fascinated.

One time I gave a lesson on
foreign words that have come

into English, typhoon, and tea,
and cooley and some of

these other words.

And he would always very
carefully incorporate those

into his vocabulary.

He was also interested in using
the local dialect, and

Sichuanese has a very
fertile dialect.

For example, in the 20s, if you
want to insult somebody

you call them a toothbrush.

You'd say [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

And so he would often use that
term in English as well.

When I was teaching he was
never the kind of kid who

would be raising his hand or
always going out of his way to

participate.

Usually he was back
in the back of the

room studying something.

And then when I would walk
behind he'd covered it up.

And sometimes it was a
dictionary, sometimes it was

something else.

I remember one time after class
he came up to me and

said very carefully, he said,
Mr. Hessler, how is your

premature ejaculation?

And this had been the type a
term that Willie was always

studying in the back of the
room and practicing his

pronunciation.



He had really a peasant
sense of humor.

Nothing was out of bounds
for Willie.



Willie also had a girlfriend
whose name was Nancy.

And during his senior year,
Willie, I remember, I started

receiving his assignments.

And suddenly I received
assignments with the name

William Foster written
across the top.

And Willie had decided that
Willie was not good enough for

him, that he needed two names.

And then a little bit
later it became

William Jefferson Foster.

And his reasoning was that I
have a Chinese name that was

given to me, a surname and a
given name, and he saw no

reason why he should not have
the same in English.

And he had named himself William
Jefferson after Bill

Clinton because Bill Clinton
was from a poor part of

America but became a success.

Willie's girlfriend had the
English name Nancy, and she

also went fishing
for a last name.

And she happened asked Adam the
fellow teacher, and she

ended up becoming Nancy Drew.

But knowing Willie, most of my
students were sort of destined

to return to their hometowns
and teach.

That was the plan.

And the government had
intended that.

The government had subsidize
their education under the

understanding that they would
return home to teach.

But there were always ways out
of this as with so many things

in China, if you could,
sometimes you would pay a fine

or you would make the
right connections.

But somehow if you didn't want
to do this you could find a

way out, but it took
some initiative.

But I can always pick
out the students who

weren't going to stay.

And Willie was certainly one of
the ones who I expected to

leave.

And this was a ritual every
spring, Sichuan Province.

I sort of wish I had a map,
but it's right in

the center of China.

It's a very heavily populated,
mostly rural province, and

it's right in the heart
of the country.

And, of course, most of the
economic boom is along the

coastal areas.

And there is a ritual every
spring where employers from

these coastal areas would come
to Fuling, to Sichuan, to look

for new talent basically because
they could hire young

people from a town like this for
a fraction of the cost in

these boomtowns.

And one group that often came
was private schools.

Private schools would
come looking for

talented young teachers.

And in Willie's senior year
a private school came from

Wenzhou which is a city on the
eastern coast. I'll talk more

about Wenzhou in a minute.



A man named Mr. Wong came, and
he was an older man, very

distinguished looking.

He always wore a Mao suit, the
sort of army green khaki suit

that the Chinese call
a Sun Yat Sen suit

that we call Mao suit.

He said he was a member of the
Communist party, and he was

particularly interested
in hiring other

Communist party members.

But mostly he was looking for
talented people, and he

promised that the job, if they
came to teach at his private

school, that they would be paid
about $100 a month, which

was more than twice as much
as they would make in the

villages, and they would
have free housing.

So there was sort of a buzz
that went through the

classroom after this
presentation by this private

instructor.

But it took a lot of guts to
leave. And as a lot of

students talked about
it, but very few of

them took the chance.

Now you may have heard about
migration in China.

It's sort of probably one of
the most important social

issues today.

There are 140 million migrants
in China, people from the

countryside who have moved to
the city, and usually from

rural backgrounds.

I think our image of this is
often of very poor people

driven to the cities, but in
a way it's very similar to

American immigration.

We also have the
same tradition.

if you give me your huddled
masses, give me

your tired, your poor.

But, in fact, immigrants who
come to an American, who came

to America, often are the most
capable people in their

communities.

They might be poor when they
arrive in comparison, but they

are people who were able to find
ways out and were able to

take risks, and it's the
same thing in China.

Migrants tend to be people
who are willing to do

this, take this step.

And in my classes I
often saw that.

The good students figured
out how to go.

And in Willie's case, he applied
for this job along

with Nancy.

But because neither of them was
a Communist party member

they weren't sort of favored.

And they were not getting
any good feedback

from the college officials.

The college had to release their
documents for them to

leave. And finally Willie, one
day near graduation, went to

visit the Communist party
secretary of the English

department.

And he sat down with him in his
home, visited him in his

home and said Mr. [? P ?], I
would really like to go to

Wenzhou to teach English.

I hope there's something
you can do to help me.

And then he put an envelope on
Mr. P's tea table and left.

And the envelope contained
about $60, which was an

enormous amount of money for
somebody like Willie.

His father made about
$500 a year.

And he did the same thing with
another Communist party

official on campus.

And sure enough his documents
were released and he was able

to leave and go to the east
coast and sort of seek his

fortune in this boomtown.

Now I would like to read from
the first letter that he wrote

me after he left.



This was after I had returned to
Beijing and was becoming a

writer 1999.

"Dear Pete, how is it going
with you at present?

I hope that you are not feeling
lonely while in the

city of Beijing.

Some Chinese girls will be sure
to have the hots for you.

But better be careful--"
Wait I'm sorry.

This is the wrong letter.

[LAUGHTER]

PETER HESSLER: Believe me,
it's all the same.

OK, we got to do
this in order.

You're going to notice
a theme anyway.

OK, this is the first letter.
"Dear Pete, I was perfectly

glad to hear from
you this time.

In my view it should be a great
news for China since

there is an extra foreign
toothbrush from the other side

of the Pacific Ocean.

Probably you are bedding
a Chinese bitch

when my letter arrived.

Anyway please read it.

It can be used as Viagra.

My job in the school
isn't so good.

I feel too tired.

In fact, we are [? coolies ?]

in the school.

We are discriminated.

So there is an old bitch who
is in charge of salary.

She's undersexed and mean.

She can never get any pleasure
from anything except money."

Half a year passed.

"I am feeling better.

Anyway I'm glad I can come
to [? Zhejiang ?]

Province.

After all there are more
opportunities here.

I'm still working
hard in English.

For I have zealotry
in this language.

I have confidence in myself that
one day I will be a VIP

not like a toothbrush anymore.

Meanwhile my teaching
here is successful.

You and Adam are somewhat my
icons in the teaching.

Pete, I hope that you will visit
me in [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

My yahoo students have itching
desire to see you.

By the way, I have several
questions for you.

One, what does KTV stand four?

That's Karaoke TV in China.

Two, what's the term, the proper
English term, for the

people who go to other cities
to earn a living, especially

farmers from Sichuan.

Three, what's the full
form of DVD?

Four, do you want to be
Chinese American?

Five, how many wives do
you want to have?

Six, are you still impotent?"
And then signed, "Yours,

Willy"

Now this may strike you as an
unusual student-teacher

relationship, but Willie
was a character.

And, in a sense, this is Chinese
countryside humor,

very informal, and often very
close to the gutter.

One of the things that had
happened to Willie when Willie

and Nancy first arrived, they
went to an island off the

coast close to the city called
Wenzhou which is a boomtown on

the east coast. And the moment
they got there they found Mr.

Wong, and he said oh, I'm story,
there must have been a

misunderstanding.

You thought that you had
the $100 a month job.

Actually that job doesn't
exist. You

must have heard wrong.

But I have a job for
half that salary.

And he said, oh I'm sorry.

You thought that there
was a free apartment.

That's not actually true.

You're going to have to find
your own apartment.

And so the first thing that they
realized was basically

that they had been tricked into
going halfway across the

country to a place where they
had no support system at all.

And the school itself was
basically a fraud.

Willie realized that the school
had been changing

location every year.

They would find abandoned
buildings or half constructed

buildings, or old schools that
were being abandoned for new

facilities, and just finding
whatever the cheapest place

was they could rent and set up
a private school just for the

short term.

And most of the students were
people who had failed out of

public schools.

And this was a high school, and
in China the compulsory

education is only nine years.

So if a student does poorly he's
not guaranteed to have a

high school education, but
parents who wanted to send

their kids to the private
school could do that.

But in this school the kids
would arrive and realize that

they too had been tracked,
and that

everything was low quality.

And then they would leave
as soon as possible.

And Willie was fined
for every student

there who did not stay.

So it was an incredibly rough

introduction to the new economy.



And of course Mr. Wong and the
wife, Willie wrote about the

wife who only cared
about money.

She was the one who dock
his pay if he had

students who left.

And Mr. Wong himself was always
talking probably about

his years in the Communist
party and his military

service, which was always
mysterious.

Mr. Wong's office had only one
book, the massive book that

was entitled in Chinese
A Record of the

World's Famous People.

And this book, when Willie
leafed through it, only name

that he recognized
was Mr. Wong.

And it was seemed to be one of
these things where you paid to

sort of have yourself
into this book.

And it was another device that
this entrepreneur used to sort

of convince people that
what he was doing

was actually education.

I would like to read another
letter, the second letter that

he wrote me later that spring.

"Dear Pete, how's it going
with you at present?

I hope that you're not feeling
lonely in the city of Beijing.

Some Chinese girls will be sure
to have the hots for you.

But you better be careful
because Chinese girls always

blow hot and cold.

It has been raining all
these days here.

My feeling is just
like the raining.

Actually I'm a little bit
bored and annoyed by the

things around me
in the school.

For a long time I have
no mood for teaching.

As soon as I stand on the
platform of a classroom I hope

that the bell rings.

All the students are yahoos.

Some of them are brutal
and uneducated.

Many of the students want to
drop out of the school while I

fail to block the way
out for others.

Many yahoos notice that
they have been had.

Surely more students will
escape from the school.

What interests me most is that
I can learn English via VOA

and a dictionary of American
colloquialism.

I hope that in a short time
I can put them into use

correctly and freely.

Afraid that my strong will
will be damaged, I wish

myself a way out.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

is a very small place.

In other words, I'm somewhat
isolated from the wonderful

outside world.

I'm afraid I will not be able to
use English well as long as

I stay here.

You see, I have zealotry about
the English language which is

considered to be my better
half all my life."

I'd like to talk a little
bit about his

relationship with language.

First of all, that term
yahoo that he uses, my

students had studied.

I taught literature, and he had
picked that up and from

Gulliver's Travels.

They had no idea about
the company, Yahoo!

But they loved the word partly
because it sounds like a

Chinese word.

And actually in Szechuan they
can't distinguish between Fs

and Hs, so the students would
often call it yafoo.

Yafoo is the way that
they said it.

Willie, even when he moved to
this job and was immediately

disappointed, he was convinced
that he still would have

opportunities if he improved
his English.

So every night he would listen
to the Voice of America or the

BBC, and would transcribe pages
and pages of English.

During the time that he was in
this town he wore out three

dictionaries, broke the spines
of three dictionaries.

And when I visited his apartment
he had them lined up

proudly on his bookshelf like
the way that an outfielder

would keep his gold glove,
never throw it away.



One of his favorite programs
was called see American

Metaphors on Voice of America
where he could use colloquial

statements.

But the problem with that, of
course, is on Voice of America

there's never any obscenities.

But Willie solved that problem
one day when he found a

dictionary that was called
A Dictionary of American

Euphemisms. And that turned
out to be devoted almost

entirely to the scatological,
and sexual, and all the things

that Willie was interested.

One time I was visiting him,
and picked up the book and

just randomly opened
it to a page.

And the first word that sort
of jumped out at me was

dominatrix.

But this was away from him to
supplement his vocabulary.

But he was, as he said,
he was somewhat

isolated from the boomtown.

That was his interest. He had
gone to the east to look for

life in a boomtown, and he was
on the outskirts of Wenzhou.

I don't know if anybody
has heard of Wenzhou.

It's one of the most famous
new cities in China.

They're famous because after
the reformers began in the

1980s, Wenzhou Joe was one of
these places that responded

very quickly.

They had had a history of doing
business before the

Communists came to power.

Because Wenzhou is
geographically isolated from

the rest of China.

It's very hard for them
to go to the interior.

So from ancient times on
they were traitors.

They used their coastal
position to do trade.

And they always had
contact abroad.

There were Wenzhou people
everywhere.

And so after the reformers
began, even though the

government never gave them a
special preference, the people

responded very quickly.

And often it was sort of
bootstrap capitalism.

It wasn't for an investment.

It was local investment.

And so often they would
start very small and

then gradually expand.

And what that meant was
that often they

made very simple products.

And a family would start a small
warehouse, and then they

would expand, expand, expand,
and eventually get bigger.

And eventually Wenzhou became
famous for certain things,

became famous for shoes.

Right now 600 million
pairs of shoes a

year are made in Wenzhou.

They're famous for cigarette
lighters.

70% of the world cigarette
lighters come from this city.

I drove through this area
recently, and all around this

town, all around the city
are other small towns.

Each of them has found a
niche in the economy,

in the global economy.

I drover through one place and
I noticed that everywhere I

looked there was playground
equipment.

It was called [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

And sure enough I stopped to
check and there were 270

factories there that were making
jungle gyms basically.

And that was 50% of the Chinese

market for that product.

I went through a place called
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

where, in the center of town,
they had an enormous statue

that had a button with wings.

And it turned out that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

is the button capital
of China.

They had 380 factories
making buttons.

They're also famous
for zippers.

I went over to a place called
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], and I asked

people there what do you make.

And some guy pulled out a
pack of playing cards.

And sure enough, when I looked
into the statistics,

[UNINTELLIGIBLE] makes more
than a billion decks of

playing cards a year.

So this whole landscape
is like this.

You have [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
which makes

underwear and bras.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

makes hardware.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE] is
famous for locks.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

makes faucets.

There is a place named
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

which is known for making
ping pong paddles

and badminton rackets.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE] makes lace.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

makes 1/3 of the
world's socks.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

makes 350 million umbrellas
a year.

And there's a place called
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

that produces 40% of the
world's neckties.

And even in China it's sort of
a mystery how the Wenzhou

people do it.

And when you travel in China you
often see books about the

Wenzhou business model.

What can we learn from
the Wenzhou people?

The last time I was in Wenzhou
I stopped in the airport, and

there were nearly a dozen books

about business in Wenzhou.

One book was called The Secrets
of How Wenzhou People

Make Money.

Another one was called The
Wenzhou Code: Deciphering the

Culture of a Kingdom
of Business.

Another one was 36 Examples of
Money-earning Wenzhou People.

And another book was called
The Jews of the East: the

Commercial Stories of 50
Wenzhou Businessman.

I actually met an entrepreneur
who explained to me very

seriously, he said, you know in
Europe, they say that the

Jews are the Wenzhou
people of Europe.

That was his perspective
on it.

I happen to be and Wenzhou
for Valentine's Day.

It's a good place to spend
a romantic holiday.

And the local paper had a survey
where they had surveyed

20 Wenzhou Joe millionaires to
ask them about Valentine's.

These were all men, and the
asked them, what do you do for

Valentine's Day?

What do you give your wife, and
these sort of questions.

And one of the questions they
asked was if you had to choose

between your business
and your family,

which would you choose?

60% chose their business, 20%
chose their family and 20%

couldn't make up their minds.

So that says something about
the Wenzhou model.



In Wenzhou the economy is 90%
private, and that has actually

come to include education.

In this city even private
schools have

found a distinct niche.

Now China education is still
strictly controlled by the

Communist party.

You cannot start a school and
begin to teach theories that

are not kosher.

And so, in a sense, if you're
starting a private school some

of your options are limited.

You can't have a radically
different curriculum.

But what the private schools
realize is that they can teach

the same stuff basically
at a higher volume.

In a way, I mean this is an area
that their economic model

basically is margin
production.

They're not involved
in innovation or

high value-added goods.

They are making very simple
things, but they find ways to

cut the margins.

And in education they did the
same thing essentially.

For example, the school were
Willie taught distinguished

itself because they began
teaching English in first

grade instead of in
sixth grade like

local public schools.

And that became their niche.

And, of course, the public
school quickly responded, but

the private school was always
a little bit ahead.

For example, in Willie's school,
the students who were

in their examination year would
have class every day of

the week including Sunday.

The eighth graders had 75
class hours a week.

That's more than ten hours a day
in the classroom, whereas

the average Chinese public
school has 45.

And like so many things in
China the competition was

incredibly intense.

In Willie's generation one of
the lessons is of movement,

another lesson is simply
competition.

This is the first generation
that has been forced to

compete on the free market.

And this was something that,
whenever I talked to Willie,

this weighed on him very heavily
because in his school

there had been a public school
that decided they were going

to drive his private school
out of business.

And every year there was a
cutthroat competition between

who would send the most
students, graduating students,

to the good high school.

Because the goal was to have
your eighth grade students

qualify for the good high
school, and they competed on

these terms.

And, of course, the first stage
of competition was to

study as much as possible.

They realized if you prepare
diligently then you're going

to do better on the exam.

But very quickly, they realized
that if you actually

know the questions
in advance you're

going to do even better.

And it did not take the people
in Wenzhou very long to get to

that point.

And by the time Willie was at
the school an enormous amount

of energy was being invested in
cheating basically, trying

to find leaks in the
examination.

And so every year Willie would
tell me they would invite a

member of the Ministry of
Education from Wenzhou, from

the city government, to
come and give a talk.

And the idea was that he would
leak information because he

was known for doing this.

And so he would come in Willie
said they were take him out to

a fine meal and then
they would give him

a few hundred dollars.

And then they would hire
a young woman to spend

some time with him.

And I asked Willie what
does that mean?

Is she a prostitute?

And he said, what do
you think it means?

And every year the man would
give them some tips for the

exams. And every year the tips
turned out to be false.

One time I ask him well, why
do you continue to do this?

He said, you don't know.

Maybe next time it
will be accurate.

That was the perspective
in the school.

But every year it seemed
to be the same ritual.

And every year I received
a letter about this.

One year he wrote, "the same
thing happened again.

Many other schools got the info
about the high school

examinations.

Our school got a little
secondhand or

maybe third hand info.

So we are doomed to failure.

Again the fucking guy from the
Educational Administration let

out the secret of the
examination." So he would

often give the secret to the
schools that paid more, and

the other ones would be
left without much.

Now I'd like to talk a bit about
the climate for a young

person like this.

One of the issues of migration
is simply what is it like for

a young person who goes this
far from home in China?

One thing, obviously, is
they suddenly enter an

entirely new economy.

The sense of competition was
totally different from what

someone like Willie
had grown up with.

But even the culture was
totally foreign.

One year another of my former
students who was called

Shirley wrote me a letter
after she migrated

to that same area.

And she wrote, "Peter, until now
I never get the feeling of

living in a completely
different place.

It's not good to feel.

I can understand now what you
and Adam said to us before.

You said you were foreigners,
and that makes a difference in

people's heart.

For the native, you
are a stranger.

It's hurtful because
they don't group

you in their group.

You can understand
what they say.

So the feeling of home clings
to you naturally.

Here we can't understand
what the natives say.

They're dialects are strange to
us because their tone and

rhythm are so far different
from ours.

We can only speak standard
Chinese, but some natives can

understand standard Chinese,
especially the older people."

I think sometimes we have
a vision of China as a

monolithic place, and people
speak Chinese.

But the truth is that it's
incredibly diverse, and

especially from a linguistic
point of view.

The languages of China are
about as diverse as the

languages spoken in the romance
parts of Europe.

And if somebody from Sichuan
goes to Wenzhou, they won't

understand a word that the
locals are saying.

The languages are
that different.



So many of my former students
who left home, at some point,

they always wrote me
a letter like this.

Now I know what it's like
to be a foreigner.

So, in a sense, it was the first
time for them to view

their country as if through
an outsider's eyes.

One year Willie wrote to me
about his experiences there.

Often they would experience
prejudice

of one form or another.



For example, when Willie was in
that town he noticed that

the teachers from Sichuan
tended to be

paid lower, paid less.

He noticed that factories
sometimes would have signs up

that would say, we don't want
anybody from Sichuan Province

or [? Zhejiang ?]

I was recently in one of these
factory towns watching

recruiting at a factory.

And as workers were coming in
looking for jobs, potential

workers, there was a guard at
the gate who was checking

everybody's ID, and anybody who
was from Wenzhou Province

he turned away.

And I asked him why,
and he said, well,

we don't like them.

They fight too much.

And really because Wenzhou
was a fairly

poor part of the country.

It's like, in America, if you
had a guard at the gate saying

nobody from Alabama can come
here, no workers from

Mississippi.

And Willie once commented to me
that when he was a child,

he said, when he was growing
up, his parents would often

threatened, or adults in the
village would often threaten

children if there are bad by
saying, if you don't behave,

the foreigners are going to
come and steal you, or the

foreigners are going to
come and eat you.

And in Wenzhou, in the new
economy, he would hear people

say, if you're not good the
migrants are going to get you,

the people from Sichuan or the
people from [? Zhejiang ?].

So, in a sense, they had
become foreigners.

One year he wrote to me, "I
completely understand what

you're feeling when you're
treated differently in China.

Obviously the Sichuanese
people were treated

differently by other people.

For Sichuan is very famous for
being poor and backward.

Here the same thing happens.

People from Sichuan and
[? Zhejiang ?] were always

looked down on by the natives.

I don't care much about that.

I know that China is not
their China only.

Each citizen in China has the
equal right to go anywhere in

China."

So I think this is one of the
more interesting aspects of

migration is, first of all, the
new perspective, but also

the sense of being
an individual.

He was making a decision
that it doesn't matter

what group he's from.

He is the same as anybody else,
and he should be treated

the same way.

Of course, the flip side of
this is when you look at a

young person like this in China,
what is the option if

you were from the countryside?

And this is something else
that's quite striking.

For a young person from the
countryside, more and more

living in the village
is not sustainable.

There are still jobs there.

There are still farming
positions.

But compared to these boomtowns,
the gap is growing

wider and wider.

And by now Willie was one
of the first from

his class to migrate.

But by now he says pretty much
everybody that he grew up with

is gone, is gone from
the village.

And he often described to me how
when he went back to his

hometown nobody was there except
the older people, and

nothing had changed.

And he's living in a place in
these factory towns where the

infrastructure is being
built constantly.

Everything is changing
day to day.

And then he would go back
to the village and

it would feel dead.

One year after returning home
and visiting his parents he

wrote, "when I am home nothing
has changed and the roads are

still rough and people
are getting older.

It makes me sad that I cannot
find familiar people or

friends who I knew well
when I was young.

Sometimes I think this kind of
life, going out to the coastal

regions without a stable home,
is the saddest and most

stressful thing in the world."

In some ways, whenever I read
these kind of comments, it

made me think of descriptions
of the industrial revolution

in England and in Europe where
young villages were basically

emptying out as people went to
the centers of productivity.

And in China we're seeing the
same thing but at a much

faster pace.

There are villages in a Beijing
outskirts where I

often go hiking and camping.

And a number of times I've come
upon villages that are

completely abandoned, just
totally empty, a group of

maybe ten houses.

One time I stumbled onto a group
of ten houses that were

just the walls were
falling apart, the

roofs were caving in.

It was like a ghost town.

But then when I went in the
houses had been wallpapered in

the traditional countryside
manor with newspapers.

And so you can read the
headlines and read the dates.

The newspapers were
from 1986, 1987.

And that told me that the
houses had been lived in

fairly recently, but it
showed how fast this

change had come about.

In the matter of less than 20
years a place to go from being

a vibrant village where people
were improving their houses to

being a ghost town.

So this is the climate
for young Chinese.



I think actually this
is sort of an

introduction to Willie's story.

But I don't want to go too long
before I get to questions

because I want to give
you a chance to see

what interests you.

His story is something that I
continue to follow in this

book, Oracle Bones looking at
how he copes with this new

environment and with new
competition that he

experiences there.

So now I'd just like to leave
the floor open for any sort of

questions that you might have
about his story or about

anything else in China.
