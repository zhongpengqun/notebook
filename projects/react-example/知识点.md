- Class components and Function components
`Before React 16.8, Class components were the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component. Function components were considered "state-less".
With the addition of Hooks, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a Class component in React.`
